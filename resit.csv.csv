The movie is an absolute must-see - let's get that out of the way from the top. For me, it's probably the best, most artistic action film since the original Matrix. Furiosa (Charlize Theron) is clearly the best heroine since Ripley in the Alien films. Going in, I figured the action would be fatiguing, and the desert backdrop would get samey after a while, but I couldn't have been more wrong on both counts. Miller's inventiveness knows know bounds. If I had to point to a slightly weak link in the chain, it would be the Immortan Joe character. No doubt, he's fun to look at and provides some of the comedy, but as a character, he is not nearly as personally threatening as the chief baddies in the original Mad Max and Road Warrior flicks.

(When it ended, nobody in my theater moved for a period of time, and there was no round of applause  mostly, it seemed, because of the shock of it all. Clapping didn’t seem like the right thing to do.)  The fact that we experience the story from the perspective of a kidnapped free man makes the film instantly relatable.  I was so happy to have watched all of Tom Fontana’s excellent “Copper” which features an African American civil war veteran doctor living in New York, and all of his family’s struggles in Five Points.  Solomon, a New Yorker kidnapped from Washington DC, could be any of us.  The Southern landscape as it likely existed in those days provides such a beautiful-yet- eerie backdrop to this movie.  What I particularly appreciate the fact that all the shots are confined  you never see very far into the distance. There’s never any perspective on things. When the boat transporting the kidnapped south moves, you see the paddlewheels. On the plantations, you see the three or four acres where the slaves live.  You never get any aerial shots, which is so effective in giving you a disoriented, lost feel.  Even if Solomon wants to escape, he has no idea where the hell he is, and neither do we.

The plot is familiar but the creativity and conceptualisation of Pixar to tell the story from inside the mind of a girl using five different emotions - joy, sadness, anger, disgust and fear have brought their latest picture to secure the Oscars. Not only focusing on the emotions, the story further expands into memories (short/ long-term and core memories), imagination, dreams and forgetfulness in a fantastic landscape to construct the feeling, mind, reaction and soul of the main character. This original approach connects well both the adults and children, emotionally engaging, entertaining, visually colorful and inspiring. The level of intellectual and emotional daring are consistent until the end of this major emotion animation, reminding audiences the balancing of all these five feelings that leads to the human's capability of love and affection."" ]";0;0;0;0;1;0

The performance of Martin Freeman as Bilbo Baggins is still promising as his fear, courageous and emotions are strongly inspiring across the trilogy while Richard Armitage also portrays well with his change of behavior as Thorin, the visual effects are undeniable dazzling and stunning, but there is a few part that seems to be just semi-real, not to miss out Howard Shore's scores are awesome as always for all the six entries. While the story line moves in an extreme fast pace with short conversations and it may seems somewhat diverts from the usual tradition of the middle earth saga, The Hobbit trilogy is pleasing at it is, serves a decent connection bridge to Lord of the Ring and the ending with theme song \""The Last Goodbye\"" drives audience's emotion to feel reluctant for farewell.

The performances of Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman are extremely outstanding, thanks to the character developments that allow them to be both the antagonist and protagonist at the same time due to their eagerness for glory that they have eroded not only the morality of this magical great art, but to sacrifice their own lives and the one they love. The duality is a brilliant central concept of the film extracted in two different ways on both leads, it never stops engaging but to challenge the mindset of the viewers with several dark twisted plots and ambiguity.

Having written the script himself with the help of Lawrence Kasdan, the mastermind behind arguably the best Star Wars film \""The Empire Strikes Back\"", Abrams said that the movie was going back to its original roots and the whole film was basically a faithful recreation of the space magic George Lucas had once shown us. After watching the film, I couldn’t agree more or less with his statement. “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” is an embodiment of the original trilogy (the good ones of course) that we all got to love and worship and, furthermore, is a testament to the fact that regardless of the crazy hype and commercialization the old sci-fi space adventure franchise still stands firm through the ages, enough for audiences of all shapes and sizes to thoroughly enjoy and be happy with. Let’s be clear with this; I’m not saying the movie breaks any new ground. Character and plot development is still a bit rushed and shallow, as well as glimpses of the infamous corny dialogue still stick out now and then during the course of the film. But then again, I can’t say this is a terrible film either.

Overall, \""Star Wars: The Force Awakens\"" is a true Star Wars film right down to the bone marrow, with all the pros and cons of its original predecessors. Director J.J. Abrams, like he did with the Mission Impossible and Star Trek series, blows off the dust of an old series and refines it  with a movie good enough for both Star Wars manias and average joes to run for a giddy old-fashioned space ride.

The protagonists are developed in a very realistic form, with respect but not gently at all, we reach the center of each one, you get to know what moves them, what hunts them, which are their profound desires.

The secondary roles are not forgotten; everyone has their own struggles, that are independent of the main conflict, but leads them to participate.

It is beautiful because not everything leads to war and practically all the answers are with a language expert. The film is based on Ted Chiang’s short tale Story of your Life; the director and screenwriters succeeded taking this great story, but developing a mild yet interesting plot, by adding the pressure of an imminent war (the book is a bit slow and hard to follow without that); deciding to represent the Heptapod’s spaceships like a semicircular shape and the language in a circular form (much more clear that the book). Another great choice was addressing the main conflict from multiple points of view, but keeping doctor Banks in the spotlight, with her own conflicts and the way she embraces this new communication style. One big problem was the way in which it is revealed the gift that learning the language gives, both in book and film are forcibly explicit.

This is formed by small families, in which neither of the parents have time to raise their children, so that job is done by a black maid, which in some cases are treat like a slave. The relation between the housewife and the maid is ruled by an unbreakable protocol; the black employees must use another bathroom than the family, different dishes to eat, not share food or drink with a white person and not touch a white adult because they can spread disease; but, and here is the paradox, they can take care of the children.

frankenweenie;9;NedRyerson1;/user/NedRyerson1;Jan 24, 2013;"[ ""Frankenweenie is the best animated movie from Tim Burton of all time, because apart from the typical gothic-expressionist environment and characters, we see that science is in between. First we have the signature character of this director, who in this case is a misunderstood boy without friends, although here is expanded to other people of the story, unlike most of Burton pictures. In addition to Victor, there is Elsa (animated Winona Ryder), Mr. Rzykruski (animated Vincent Price), Edgar, Weird Girl, Toshiaki, Bob and Nassor; all these characters are very well physically constructed and have a defined personality. Second, the vision of the science that brings Tim Burton to the plot is awesome, and it is defined by two things that are said by Mr. Rzykruski: people like what science gives them but not the questions that science asks; and, science is not good or bad, but it can be used in both ways. Third, the idea of gothic mixed with science gives the film a fresh air and it is reflected in the moment when the other boys have their experiments. The thing here is that with these series of creatures, we notice the different approaches to science: love of Victor, ignorance of Edgar, over-confidence of Toshiaki, superiority of Nassor, fear of Bob and accident of Weird Girl. Other great things on this movie are the use of Frankenstein elements and the outstanding application of camera, in the picture are noticeable transitions from one images to another, flip over (360 turn) and the famous vertigo effect, formed by simultaneously dolly in and zoom out. Tim Burton could have a perfect film, but the end should be different."" ]";3;3;3;0;0;0

It is amazing how this film manage to show so much with little things, and those are a father with a son in need, a woman with an uncommon job and a dysfunctional love relationship. The director also apply small camera shots and low lighting, in order to demonstrate in a better way the emotions of the characters and the cruelty of the reality. The idea of the story is to exhibit Ali, a man that suddenly becomes in charge of his son, but the thing is that he does not know how to do it. When he or his son gets hungry, he looks for food scraps or steals from a store. If he needs money, he works in whatever it takes, no matter if other people get hurt. And when he is angry or stressed, he goes to a fight club. The protagonist is like an animal, does what he wants when he wants. So out of nowhere, he meets Stephanie, a killer whale trainer. And as the same as her whales, she will train Ali to face the world correctly. That is why he is rust, like a metal that cannot withstand the environment. And he needs to become bone, like Stephanie, that resists every obstacle in life. The most overwhelming part is the scene after the accident when she is on the rooftop of her building, practicing the old routine with the killer whales. You can notice that when she raises her arms, her eyes reflect an ineffable feeling of nostalgia, but with a willing of fighting."" ]";1;1;1;0;0;0

The idea of a man that falls in love with an OS is exceptional but not so strange as it sounds, because in the society that we live the technology is like air, we can't live without it; and probably in a nearby future a relationship between human and computer would be possible. This thing makes the movie so unique; there have been lots of films about the future, but Her shows one that actually could happen. The message that is hidden below is about something that the protagonist does and that sometimes we also do it, which is to take shelter in the technology because of the fear to face the reality. That explains the job that Theodore has, why he is passing throw a divorce and also why he is so lonely. In addition to him there is Samantha, the voice of the OS, the amazing thing about her is that she is discovering the world, learning of life experiences and evolving as a consequence. I still cannot believe how Scarlett Johansson manage to transmit these, you can feel the wonder in her voice, how she test human feelings and her reaction when those things overwhelm her. Spike Jonze gives us a masterpiece with strong direction and screenplay, a beautiful original song and heartbreaking performances (Scarlett Johansson deserves all the prizes of film industry)."" ]";0;0;0;0;1;0
interstellar;9;NedRyerson1;/user/NedRyerson1;Jan  8, 2015;"[ ""Interstellar is a mind-blowing movie, there is no way to summarize it in  order to convince the audience to go see it. The next work of Christopher  Nolan arrives with much more strength than Inception, not only because we  jump from dreams to space, but also because is noticeable the consolidation  that reached this director. First is the setting of the story, the life of  mankind in the Earth has come to an end, although the interesting thing is  how Nolan shows it, from the point of view of a family. Here it is clear  the importance that acquires the human side in the story (which is also  present in Nolan's filmography), and this theme from the beginning to the  end is the protagonist. Some examples are the decision that Cooper has to  make, whether going to space but miss seeing his children grow or stay; and  the other one is probably the most heartbreaking scene of the movie, when  the protagonist sees the compilation video (astonishing performance btw).  This whole thing aims to evaluate human behavior, sometimes subconsciously  (Inception, Memento) and others rationally (Interstellar), but both about  survival instincts. Another amazing things about the picture are: the  visual effects, obviously, how the crew gather the current info and  theories about the aspect of a real dark hole; second, how it exhibits the  concept of relativity; and finally, the representation of time as a  tangible dimension. The film keeps you on the edge of your seat for nearly  3 hours, definitely nothing like what has been seen before."" ]";2;2;2;0;0;0

So this film was not known to many people, but I am lucky to watch this. The film was based on the Norwegian play called 'The Wild Duck'. It was adapted several times for the screen, but this is the latest and a modernised version. The first film for the director and he was amazing in handling the screenplay as well. Obviously I did not know anything about the film. The cast looked good and also the storyline, so that's my reason to watch it. It began like a simple drama about a family who are going through a difficult time after the wood mill was shut down in their small town. Their's daughter, Hedvig, who is studying in the high school worries that she's going to lose her boyfriend if they move out of the town. That's not it, the narration had layers like from other people surrounding this small family and their perspective too has a big impact on the storytelling."", ""Not just this family, but many from the town were out of the job and that leads to some unexpected decisions.

He accidentally meets his childhood friend which is actually a Hedvig's father. They spend lots of time together and that's where a new issue arises. Christian reveals some hidden truth for the decades between their two families. Everything breaks loose and becomes impossible to fix it. From all this, the daughter is the one who directly get affected, but to learn how is why you should watch this film."", ""You won't immediately understand the meaning of the title. The film very smartly progresses like bit by bit with lots of suspense around. The best part is, it never reveals the actual secret at any length of the film, but still the viewers going understand the situation very clearly. That's really amazing, particularly the writing being so clever. I don't know the original material which is more than a hundred year old, but I loved this to tell the story in a smart way."", ""\""You do not need to be scared of the truth.\"""", ""The characters were the best part of the story. The switching time was excellently done. Like the whole film is not intended to deal with one particular issue, but multiple. Everybody had something to deal with, some were personal and some were concerned for their whole family. The story always engaged with details, so there's no time for relaxation for the viewers. In the first half it succeeds to keep everything neat, despite the story developed from different angles. Because the end pulls them all together to conclude the tale on high. High mean, neither happy or sad, the timing when the twist takes place was a perfect setting."", ""If you are a melodrama fan, this must not be missed. I haven't seen a good tearjerker for a long time and then I found this one unexpectedly. I did not know the film would turn this way, but that's one of the reasons why I liked it a lot. The twist at the final act was kind of predictable if you were focused enough in the early part, but nobody gets a clear picture of how it all ends. That's the point. Despite how the film characters react when the suspense was revealed, we have our own respond too, but unable to deliver where it requires. That is funny, but the film gets very serious towards the final segment and you get no time to react, you will be like unmoved till the end credits roll up. But sensing a tragedy is certain."", ""I recently saw 'Fathers & Daughter', that I anticipated something what this film offered. The story lines are completely different from these two films, but that father and daughter relationship thing, I liked very much from this one. Especially the emotions are the most crucial to narrate the tale and this film was way better in that perspective. Comparison between these two titles only on the sentimental side, other than that it's not fair to bring a debate on them. Anyway, both are the fine melodrama."", ""This film definitely would appeal strongly to the family audience and I highly recommend it to them. There's no strong nudity or the sex scenes, but thematically it goes some length to record the required event. Other than those couple of parts, this is a film for everybody. Very satisfied with the overall film. I might not consider it my favourite, but very close to be called one. Like I said the story was thoroughly written, so I'm feeling this film won't go unnoticed.

Because they say only what we wanted to listen. So if we pressure them, they will fall in line. And this thing is badly needed to come to effect in the United States. If the America change their attitude, so the world would, because that's what had followed in the 21st century. But it seems they are lagging behind compared to the Baltic countries who are going fossil fuel- free nations."", ""This film's title referred as from the bible, like Noah's ark story.

So there's nothing wrong to call it another version of 'Driving Miss Daisy'. In fact, it was made by the same director."", ""Like I said, Eddie Murphy nailed his part. I hope he does more serious films like this and according to his age. I think this is what Adam Sandler should follow as well. The entire story was told from the Charlie's perspective that payed by the young sensation Britt Robertson. She was good as the Eddie, but her character was not designed to highlight the film, instead her character highlights Eddie's Mr. Church. She only reveals what she saw with her own eyes about the person she respects, despite it all began with a simple dislike. Beside she never had a father, never knew who her father was, so the Mr. Church takes that place conveniently without their's knowledge."", ""A heartwarming drama for the whole family. I did not find any obscene parts. It is now in my all time favourites list. The length was perfect and the pace was excellent. There's no major twist, like that stuns you at the final stage, but there were many small twists and turns all along. The film critics got all wrong, like usual, they proved they got no brain. This is a inspiring film. You will learn how to respect people around us, who respect us. Like cooking, books, caring for each other, privacy, many fine topics were covered. So watching it with the youngsters and kids might boost their moral attitude. So I feel it is a perfect weekend family film. Highly, strongly recommended."", ""10/10"" ]";0;0;0;0;1;0

It had very nice background score in all the crucial portion of the tale. In other word to say, the movie was just like what I expected and more than that.

I never compare HOBBIT to LOTR because the time and technology differentiate both the movie (trilogy) and I request you all not to do that.

Almost a 3 hour long stretch movie did not waste much time to take us to the core of the story. Get prepared for this extremely rare voyage into the space with a logical explanation for everything you see on the screen. Well done research for the most matured and intelligent writing. All the credit must go to Nolan brothers.

His idea was to implement what the humans are understood so far about the cosmos. And he very nicely transformed those into the silver screen with the blend of human emotions.

The robots have been brilliantly realised with inventive simplicity as real puppets played by actors and not CGI."", """", ""The effects as a whole are a cinematic experience; the spaceship blasts through the void to ludicrous organ overlays and emerges overlooking the black hole, a magnificently realised singularity of ultimate light and darkness simulated using Thorne’s mathematics. Then a moment of peace, all the more accentuated after the volume, allowing us to ponder the ‘gravity’ of the situation in more ways than one."", """", ""My only word on the film’s ending is that it comes very close to undercutting Cooper’s sacrifices by letting him have his cake and eat it, but after the mind-bending finale, we’re on board enough just to go along with the ride. The word ‘stellar’ is sometimes used to describe something of an extremely high standard, but it’s hard to say now without sounding like you’re quoting Stanley Kowalski.

Like all Nolan's movies, its strongest qualities are a uniquely thought-provoking and grand plot with a centered emotional heart peppered with poignant one-liners that force the audience to question the world and their place in it. Also like most Nolan movies, its weaker parts are comprised of somewhat contrived and sloppy dialogue and questionable pacing. Some have expressed distaste with the amount of exposition as well, however I am less inclined to fault a movie with such large and far reaching ideas for packaging these ideas in a way the audience will at least to some degree understand. In a 3 hour movie you don't have the time to fully flesh out ideas naturally that may be completely foreign to the audience, thus heavier than normal exposition is needed to make sure the they are properly strapped in for the ride."", """", ""The audiovisual experience of Interstellar (especially on an IMAX screen) is bar none.

Moments that made me want to clap my hands and stand up and cheer in approval of what he was saying. Moments when I was having to hold tears back. And these moments have stayed with me a couple of days after watching the film. These moments prove how timeless the story and issues are that “Selma” presents to us and although it would be difficult not to get these across, “Selma” does so in a way unlike any other biopic."", """", ""David Oyelowo, a British actor, is fantastic and it is an absolute scandal that he has not been nominated for the Best Actor Oscar this year. Perhaps the Academy is still tapping themselves on the back for giving “12 Years a Slave” the Best Picture Oscar last year. When Oyelowo is making those speeches that King made to the Selma black clergy it was like I was watching King in the flesh. Oyelowo looks and sounds like King, effortlessly capturing his manner, grace and style and arguably most importantly his faith. Oyelowo simply pioneers the film in regards to performances, obviously helped along by the fame of his real-life counterpart, the other actors and actresses in the film simply revolve around him. This is especially obvious in the scenes where we get to see King and his colleagues deciding how to proceed in Selma. These backstage scenes seem just like how they would have been, providing an interesting viewpoint considering there isn’t a lot of material detailing what happened. In these scenes King’s colleagues also shine through, Colman Domingo (playing Ralph Abernathy) and Wendell Pierce (playing the Rev. Hosea Williams) are both worth mentioning for their performances. These scenes though do not focus on King and thus do well to emphasise that he was both not alone nor was a God of sorts, but just simply a great man, making him even more relatable and deserved of my sympathy."", """", ""Of course “Selma” is a true story and the film sticks to it throughout ultimately doing it a perfect kind of justice. The fact that the film chose Selma as what it was going to cover was a good choice. There was the “battleground” that King decided to use as a means by which to end the struggle blacks had experienced in regards to registering to vote. It’s ultimately the moments which have been well documented that are where the film thrives, “Bloody Sunday” for example. But where the film begins to waver is in its half-hearted commitment towards King’s personal life and I believe this comes from how we obviously know less about King’s personal life then what we know about him as leader of the Civil Rights Movement. It’s those scenes where we see King giving speeches or leading the marches through Selma which are the film’s best, whereas the hypothesised conversations between King and his wife, and meetings between the C.I.A. director J. Edgar Hoover and President Lyndon B. Johnson really bring the film out of focus."", """", ""“Selma” though is ultimately the best biopic I have ever seen. Although I’ve mentioned that King’s personal life for me got in the way of the film, you have to see “Selma”, not only because of how, as critic Richard Roeper put it, it’s a film that provides a history lesson but certainly doesn’t feel like a history lecture, but also because of how the film finally grants King the cinematic justice he deserves with a brilliant performance by Oyelowo."" ]";1;3;1;2;1;0
whiplash;9;TheRocksBarney;/user/TheRocksBarney;Jan 15, 2015;"[ ""“Whiplash” is initially a captivating study about what it takes to be great and what is needed to become great, and it ends as a captivating study about what it is to be great. Miles Teller (playing Andrew Neiman) and J.K. Simmons (playing Terence Fletcher) are both absolutely fantastic in their respective roles and their performances are on par with those I loved witnessing in “Birdman” and they fit perfectly, as “Birdman”’s cast did with that films respective themes, with what “Whiplash” is all about."", ""Greatness, as I mentioned earlier, is what “Whiplash” is all about. Teller’s and Simmons’ drive reflect this, and it comes through in their characters. Andrew wants to be “one of the greats” and Fletcher wants to be the man to coach one of them. Yet this is certainly the absolute minimum of what I gathered about this film before I saw it. This kind of drive is in motion about halfway through the film, and “Whiplash” has several twists and turns in it before it finishes. Teller and Simmons develop extremely complex characters and what you come to realise is that what makes them complex is their drive. Andrew for example is an initially very easy character to understand and in some ways, to relate to. We’ve all wanted to be better and get great at something. But what takes “Whiplash” in a different direction from the one where we see Andrew asking the girl behind the counter at the cinema out is Fletcher. He pushes Andrew beyond “what is expected of him”. Watching Teller develop Andrew as a character is a fun ride although Fletcher swearing, slapping and throwing cymbals at him is not so much, but it’s all for a reason."", ""But is it necessary? Fletcher believes so, calling it “an absolute necessity” in a scene where he seems to reveal himself as the grand villain, right beneath our noses this whole time. “Whiplash” asks these questions and it’s almost as if the film sprouted from them, not that they came up and were developed as the film continued to shoot. Andrew and Fletcher’s relationship is an attempt at answering them, leaving it up to you whether the answers “Whiplash” puts forward are right or wrong. Are Fletchers methods the way forward? Could Andrew harness his talent and be great without Fletcher? Did Andrew have the talent to do such a thing? Is talent even a realistic construct? “Whiplash” asks all of these questions, and puts forward its answers here."", ""Of course Teller and Simmons are fantastic too and deserve the nominations they are getting. Simmons character is particularly well developed (and funny too) and again it is a joy to witness Teller’s development. Neither character can be described really. Simmons seems describable but there seems to be something beneath him that I couldn’t figure out and in one scene we see that he isn’t quite as tough as he seems to be. What surprises me though is how Simmons keeps winning awards and Teller does not. For me they are both brilliant and one does not outdo the other because in “Whiplash” you come to think of them as entirely separate individuals, and their relationship is instead an eternal one in regards to how it can be applied to several examples and asked whether it is one required for greatness."", ""What’s also worth mentioning is the films score. It’s brilliant. It really is just a complete appraisal of Jazz.  Drums of course predominantly feature and although the score is not as good as “Birdman”s, again heavily featuring drums, the reason it is not is because the score in “Whiplash” is external and in “Birdman”, it’s internal, inside the cast’s heads. It has meaning and something to do with the film whereas in “Whiplash” it’s almost as if Jazz music and the drums in this case are being used as a way by which we can see Andrew become great. It’s another eternal concept of sorts."", ""“Whiplash” is definitely worth seeing and although I wouldn’t quite call it the film of the year, it certainly puts forward a good performance in several categories and has done well considering it was shot in 19 days and adapted from a short film. Most should come out saying “Whiplash” was a good film. It’s tense and has some good performances in it and asks questions, and talks about, greatness. It’s visually tense as well, helped along by slow-motion shots of sweat bouncing up and down off cymbals and blood dripping from a hand. Because of this, it was an utter relief, and felt hard-earned in some respects, to see the films ending."" ]";1;2;1;1;0;0

I mean it his debut, and a bloody good one at that."", """", ""\""Nightcrawler\"" is a fantastic film and for me, Jack Glyenhaal was the highlight. 100% deserved of an Oscar Nomination, perhaps a win.

It is these that come to define “Interstellar”."", ""Set in the near future, Earth cannot sustain humanity anymore, and it’s worth praising Nolan’s subtle view of it, be it seeing the New York Yankees playing on an amateur field or discovering that the Apollo missions were faked to bankrupt the Soviet Union, which Cooper (played by Matthew McConaughey) denies. This scene, whilst allowing for a sense of character development in regards to Cooper, in retrospect seems to be Nolan emphasising how he sticks to the traditional elements of film and he does so more than ever in this film, from building several rooms of a spaceship from scratch to using five industrial fans to create a dust storm, thus attributing even more of the credit for the film to him."", ""Yet as I expected, it proves very difficult for members of this all-star cast to break through both the visually stunning shots and the label of Christopher Nolan, and be noticed. Only McConaughey succeeds in doing so, although Mackenzie Foy (playing a young Murphy) and Bill Irwin (voicing the robot, TARS) deserve mentions, as does to an extent Michael Caine (playing Professor Brand) and his recital of Dylan Thomas’ “Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night”, although I still don’t entirely understand its inclusion, leaving big names such as Casey Affleck (playing Tom) and even Jessica Chastain (playing Murphy) “down in the dirt”."", ""Interstellar is a quintessentially Nolan film, meant to be seen on IMAX, imposing those classic Nolan themes of love and family whilst asking questions that I have not seen asked before, in this case winding up the scientists, although it is interesting to note that Nolan answers them by playing with several theories, instead of just getting the science completely wrong, as is so common. Yet the film is so Nolan that it takes that extra unnecessary step that Nolan always has present in his work, be it taking the audience to Limbo in Inception or by adding the twist of Miranda Tate (played by Marion Cotillard) turning out to be Talia al Ghul in The Dark Knight Rises."", ""Before I conclude, I think it is important to make this point in regards to Nolan and his (future) works. He has begun, whether he means it or not, to dwarf his own cast and to an extent his own themes and his commitment to traditional film elements. The amount of hype that goes into his films is widespread and if he isn’t careful, his future works could take a turn for the worse."", ""As I have already said, Nolan always takes that extra unnecessary step, one that I don’t think I would be so sympathetic with if it was another director, yet the brilliance of what comes before it makes up for it, often leaving me in that No Man’s Land of whether the film was worth 9 or 10 stars."" ]";1;1;1;0;0;0

I have grown to have great confidence in Christopher Nolan and his abilities as a director, and as a writer, not to mention his brother who helped him with this one. Quite ambitious to make a movie about a worm hole, even more so that the human race depends on what is on the other end for survival. My mind was blown, such a large scale with very rich and deep emotion for each character. The grandeur and the detail supersedes anything I've ever seen before.  Just when you think this movie is a little too tame, it flips you over. Isn't as structurally sound as some of his others, but this is flat out incredible.

As far as, Tony Scott films go, they're sort of hit or miss. I loved \""Man On Fire\"" and \""Unstoppable.\"" However, movies like \""Deja Vu\"" and \""The Taking Of Pelham 123\"" are just sort of \""meh\"" for me. This is partly because Mr. Scott made a very strange transition midway through his career. He went from using a really clean and traditional camera movement (as in \""Top Gun,\"" \""True Romance,\"" and \""Crimson Tide\"") to using this really frenetic and trippy camera style (as in \""Deja Vu,\"" \""Man On Fire,\"" and \""Unstoppable\""). Sometimes the latter works, sometimes it doesn't, but one thing that usually has stayed amazingly consistent throughout Tony Scott's career is a brilliant lead performance from Denzel Washington. Tony Scott and Denzel Washington have collaborated together five times, and they've crafted some amazing stuff. \""Crimson Tide\"" is no different here - Denzel sails through this movie with an utterly incredible finesse. However, while Denzel's performance is a force to be reckoned with, the best performance in this film is from none other than Popeye Doyle himself; Mr. Gene Hackman. His portrayal of Captain Frank Ramsey is one of the most menacing performances I've seen him give in a long while. Hackman owns this ship. In terms of directing, this movie in my opinion had everything \""The Hunt For Red October\"" had, yet there was just a tad more.

After watching \""Casino Royale\"" I can safely say that this film effectively restores the Bond film series, as well as the James Bond name, to everything that author Ian Fleming had originally intended. This film features one of the most dynamic portrayals of the character I've ever seen on film. Sure, everything from the previous films is there (the charm, wit, etc.), but Actor Daniel Craig brings some aspects to the character I've never seen before. He does a really profound job at accentuating just how much of a cold bastard 007 really is. Though he also does a good job at depicting the more loving side of Bond -like I said. . .dynamic. With all these different shades of Bond in tow, Craig creates, quite possibly, my favorite representation of the character. Eva Green does a fine job in her role as the beguiling treasury agent, Vesper Lynd. Green and Craig construct a deep kind of chemistry that I have yet to see any other Bond and \""Bond-girl\"" develop on film. Also, cheers to Mads Mikkelson for playing one of the creepiest Bond-villains I've ever seen. In terms of technicalities, The camerawork is very clean, and editing is logical and accurate. The soundtrack utilizes the classic Bond Theme, but it also employs some extra nuances that I found to be quite suitable for the overall tone of the film. The screenplay is very well written, giving Bond some of the funniest lines I've ever heard his character say. The action is there too, as this movie features some of the coolest and most intimidating set pieces I've seen on film. I mean like some real \""Uncharted-esque\"" stuff happens in this movie- pretty awesome.

In fact, the whole concept of \""Wilson The Volleyball\"" was not conceived until about halfway through shooting. Another interesting aspect of the film is that a very large portion of it has no dialogue, yet it still remains highly entertaining experience. Much of the film's complexity comes from the incredibly moving performance as Chuck Noland, a FedEx engineer who is tragically separated from everything he loves. Which leads me to another point, and, possibly, my favorite aspects of \""Cast Away\"" - the themes conveyed. The movie is deeply driven by the central idea that life can be cruel and unforgiving thing, but that shouldn't stop us from pursuing something better. This theme is accentuated to an enormous degree by the movies soundtrack by Alan Silvestri. Though the soundtrack is absent throughout most of the first half of this movie, the movie's main theme is slowly introduced towards the end of the film.

However, there was a time when Shyamalan actually made pretty good movies. This, thankfully, is one of the only 3 he has made. \""Unbreakable\"" is a truly compelling study of the narrative mechanics of comic books. I, being a big nerd who loves comic books, found this movie to be intensely interesting to watch because it clued me into things which I didn't know about them. Like the fact that a villains eyes are always portrayed to slightly bigger than the hero's because it shows that his view on the world is slightly more off-kilter than the hero's. And the fact that the hero's origin is often tied/interconnected with the villain's origin. These are just two of the many interesting concepts of comic book writing that are discussed throughout \""Unbreakable\"". Now make no mistake - this movie isn't a documentary. Yes, it does discuss a lot of the methods comic book writers utilize to convey their very distinct messages, but it does this verbally and nonverbally. This movie maintains a very quiet, yet intensely brooding tone. This tone is amplified by the really somber and mesmerizing performance from Bruce Willis. The cinematography is really intelligently executed, as I found myself saying, \""oh that was pretty cool/clever\"", to a very large amount of this film's shots.

Now right off the bat, if this movie were shown to the original pioneers of film (i.e. Porter, Chaplin, Capra) I can safely say that upon completion of the film they would promptly scream, yell, cry, and then explode. . . .maybe. They would definitely be appalled by what they would see. However, this does not make \""Fight Club\"" a bad film. For, film, like literature, can take on many forms and eventually evolve over time. Though the themes displayed throughout the film are definitely strange and at times shocking, they are also peculiarly thought-provoking and at times pragmatic. The movie's messages on defiance and nihilism are deeply rooted within it's very intelligently written script. The dialogue is hilarious and at times disturbingly provocative. Brad Pitt and Edward Norton are two intensely talented actors, and seeing them work together on screen is really entertaining. Though anyone who watches this movie will walk out of the film talking about Brad Pitt's unforgettable portrayal of Tyler Durden. Pitt's obvious dedication to the role, paired with the near-perfectly written script he was given, makes for a character that I will quote many a time to come. Another aspect that I found particularly unique was the cinematography. I found that Photographic Director Jeff Cronenweth did a noteworthy job with the visuals of this movie. He really succeeded in using lighting to accentuate just how dismally somnolent the narrator's life is. I also felt that the use of lighting towards the end of the film was also very aesthetic.

Every single actor in this film brought their best to the table, and it's because of the unbelievably captivating performance from Jack Nicholson that everyone else raised their bars. Nicholson's really only in this film for about 10 or 15 minutes, but man does he make those minutes count with his caustic and snide portrayal of Colonel Nathan R. Jessup. Again, it's his performance that caused everyone else in this film to bring their a-games, and holy crap did they. Tom Cruise, Kevin Pollak, Kevin Bacon, J.T. Walsh, Kiefer Sutherland, Demi Moore, all did unbelievable jobs with their respective characters. Even Wolfgang Bodison, a stagehand who had never acted before in his life, did a really beautiful job with his role. The aforementioned fact is a real testament to the seemingly limitless talent of Rob Reiner. After watching the special features of the film, you really get a good idea that Reiner forged an effective relationship with his actors and offered some acting tips of his own for their performances. Because this is such a character driven story, Reiner made a great choice in offering some of his own acting expertise to his cast. Overall, I felt that \""A Few Good Men\"" was a really masterfully directed, beautifully written, unforgettably performed coatroom drama that is sure to impress anyone."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

Neill Blomkamp creates the most intelligently crafted science-fiction films I've seen since \""Inception\"". He utilizes an incredibly innovative documentary-style cinematography to create a tangible sense of realism.

The film is about a oil rigging team that tries to survive the harsh Alaskan wildlife after their plane crashes. Let me start off by saying that Joe Carnahan has been a hit or miss director for me. He usually specializes in high octane and stylized action flicks. Movies like \""The A-Team\"", and \""Smokin' Aces\"" look cool, but they fail to impress me on an intellectual level. Now, here we have \""The Grey\"". This movie is a departure from Joe Carnahan's style. . .in a good way. This movie is toned down to a much more believable level and it has substance. A great script that has not only great dialogue and characters, but this movie's script possesses very deep philosophical and poignant moments. I walked into this film feeling that my heart strings wouldn't be threatened. This movie tugged at them up a great deal. Liam Neeson gives the best performance I've ever seen him give. I honestly thought that Neeson would be the typical badarse he's been fond of playing as of late, but his character (and all of the other as well) is so multi-dimensional, complex, and most importantly, real. The soundtrack is as touching as it is chilling. Joe Carnahan proved me wrong. This movie is a phenomenally entertaining, moving, thrilling piece of cinema.

This isn't just your average horror movie, though. No, no. In fact, in many ways it falls short of the simple identifiers that help sell modern horror pictures in general. Supernatural elements? Nope. Found footage element? Not even. Jump scares galore? Think again.

Indeed, the set design and makeup effects evoke nausea and other forms of discomfort. Of course the darkness of the story at hand (both real and metaphorical) is spooky to think about. But I say again - knowing that director Fede Alvarez is deliberately misdirecting you at every turn? THAT's horrifying.

It's been 2 years since the apes and humans had any contact with each other and Caesar isn't even sure if they are alive anymore which you can see makes him sad. Leading up to the events in this film the humans spent four years fighting the virus then the next four years fighting each other but it seems after all that the few remaining survivors live in peace in the ruins of San Francisco for the past two years.

Malcolm convinces Dreyfus to give him three days to go talk to the apes to see if they cant just gain access to the hydro dam in the forest so they can fix it so they can have electricity all over the city and they wont have any need to enter the forest.

I was never really a fan of Jason Clarke and i wasn't sure how i was going to like him being in this film seeing that he was going to be a major part of it but he actually did a solid performance which i was surprised about it also actually made me think that he wont be all that bad in Terminator: Genesis. Gary Oldman again was fantastic but of course that's nothing new, he has this one really emotional scene that ends up being one of the more memorable parts of the film.

Honestly though im not even sure how many times I've watched this movie i would have to say that its between this and The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King for the most times I've watched a movie but if i had to put a number on it though id have to say over 100 times. Richard Donner has always been one of my favorite directors with such films as Superman (1978), the Lethal Weapon movies, and Scrooged, he was one of the directors who's movies i watch a lot of growing up.

The group having had a few encounters with the Fratellis at this point finally out run them and find there way to One-Eyed Willie's hidden treasure where they load up with as much gold, gems, and pretty much anything else they possibly can get their hands on only to be caught by the Fratellis and forced to hand it all over to them. The group makes a getaway when Chunk with the help of Sloth(the Fratellis disfigured brother who they horribly mistreat) come to save the day.

Now onto the Score by Hans Zimmer while i did absolutely love it i did feel like there was a bit too much of it being used in the film by that i mean i would have liked a few more silent scenes of the spaceship just spinning around with the earth in the background or when its just out in space something to give off that \""there is no sound is space\"" feel but other than that the score was perfection. One more thing i was hoping for in the movie was that there were more scenes of stars, galaxies, and of just being in space in general, although the movie takes place in space a lot of it is spent either inside the ship or on a planet so you don't get that full immersed feeling but what we do get to see like the wormhole, the space-warp, and the few shots of planets, its just simply amazing to look at but i do understand that if they add those scenes it would only slow done a film that was already approaching 3 hours... still though i personally would have loved it."", """", ""The overall acting was solid but that's to be expected with so many great actors and with most already having worked with Nolan on previous films that wouldn't be an issue.

Despite, “Selma” (2015), directed by critically acclaimed African-American director Ava DuVernay (known for “Middle of Nowhere”(2012) and “I will follow” (2010)), is “A chronicle of MLK’s campaign to secure equal voting rights via an epic march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama in 1965”."", """", ""Firstly, I was skeptical going into this movie, very much aware that this is a two-hour biography about a certain period in a great man’s life, a hero in particular, thus this movie could be interesting but if not brilliantly handled in production, as a result could instead be dull. To my surprise, this is one of the best movies I have seen thus far this year. This was an absolute treat because it is always in January in which you can seek out films for your worst list, however “Selma” (2015) featured an outstanding, truly Oscar-Worthy performance from David Oyelowo (known for “A Most Violent Year” (2014) and “Lee Daniels’ The Butler” (2013)) in which he perfectly portrayed Martin Luther King showing not only his status but also his imperfections as a human being. Basically Oyelowo brought back MLK to life with his electrifying performance. The film also features great supporting roles from Carmen Ejogo (known for “The Purge: Anarchy” (2014)) as MLK’s devoted wife and the beloved Oprah Winfrey as Annie Lee Cooper."", """", ""Moreover, this movie has shocking intense and emotional sequences in which the “white” officers fight “black” citizens marching to Montgomery as an ask for their voting rights. The two marches are heart pounding yet enormous and highly constructed therefore, made me appreciate this feature even more. The movie is overall well-directed, well-written and sharply edited, with MLK’s speeches shinning more than ever."", """", ""In conclusion, this feature might not be appealing to most teenagers, however schools could benefit from teaching it in classes as it holds valuable information about one great icon of history. It also carries out great positive messages such as “the triumphs and challenges of the civil rights movements and the importance to gather a diverse community to fight racism”. With great positive role models mainly MLK. (“He is not “idealized” in this movie as his flaws are addressed, but he is no shortage of incredible role models among the civil rights leaders”).

Part 2 makes up for Part 1's lack of action by being the darkest, most violent and gritties Hunger Games film, even with the standards set by the previous films and succeeds in ending the saga in a suitably epic fashion. Mockingjay - Part 2 finds Katniss leading the rebels to the Capitol aiming to kill President Snow. The Gamemakers have rigged the entire city with lethal traps to make sport of their deaths, making it the most dangerous Hunger Games yet. If Part 1 was too slow or lacked adequate action, Part 2 is heart-pounding from beginning to end. The action scenes are more violent than anything seen in the series yet, making any deaths even more gut-wrenching. Fans of the series will find it hard to watch at times, and if you're like me, you'll be gripping your seat or hiding behind your shirt for a good portion of the film. The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2 ends one of the most exciting and relevant franchises today in a gripping, emotional and brutal way, and it might be the feel-bad movie of the year."" ]";2;5;2;3;0;0
the-walk;10;horcrux2007;/user/horcrux2007;Oct  6, 2015;"[ ""Robert Zemeckis' signature visual style and proclivity for bio-pics seemed perfect for a movie like The Walk, a film that manages to boast an interesting and entertaining story and dizzying cinematography. The Walk is based on the story of the real-life high wire artist Philippe Petit in 1974. Inspired by a circus he saw at a young age, Philippe begins planning an incredibly ambitious -- and highly illegal -- show in which he hangs a wire across the Twin Towers and walks across them. A majority of the story is dedicated to Petit gathering accomplices to help with the coup, practicing for the extreme conditions and planning how they will rig the wire. The clever writing allows you to connect with every character and understand why they're trying to attempt this impossible dream. The last 45 minutes or so is where \""the walk\"" actually happens. The scenes of Petit and co rigging the wire are just as tense as the wire-walking scenes, which are accented by some of the best cinematography of the year. The cinematography is really the star of the movie here. The shots panning down towards the ground make the towers almost look endless, and it adds so much tension to the walking scenes. The Walk is a stylish and entertaining look at one of the biggest artistic feats of the last century, and you need to watch it in IMAX 3D."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

In Inside Out , the life of an eleven-year old girl named Riley is shown to be controlled by five voices inside her head: Joy, Sadness, Disgust, Fear, and Anger. They control her emotions and affect her memories, but Riley's life is thrown out of control when she moves to San Francisco. Her core memories, the most important ones, are thrown out of the control center as well as Joy and Sadness, so they have to journey back to put Riley's life back on track. The plot itself doesn't contain any big twists or even a villain. It's a seemingly simple tale with huge ambition. Showing what's going on in someone's head is a difficult feat, but Pixar achieves this in such a creative and original way. The ideas presented in Inside Out might fly over younger kids' heads, as there are some rather complex themes here: you can't be happy without experiencing sadness or anger or disgust or fear. They are natural parts of life. The film even deals with depression, identity, and self-worth. Inside Out is undeniably the most enjoyable, hilarious, and entertaining film that incorporates such heavy themes. It's certainly not a movie you will ever forget."" ]";6;6;6;0;0;0

Creep, directed by Patrick Brice and starring Mark Duplass, follows Aaron who answers a sketchy craigslist ad for a one-day job to shoot a film. His client is a little weird and talkative, but Aaron realizes this man is not who he seems. It sounds generic and overdone, but Creep executes its premise in an original and memorable way. This guy, Josef, seems like a pretty normal guy. He's not a shady, mustachioed guy who drives a windowless white van, but he's also not \""too nice\"" or \""too perfect.\"" Josef is just the guy in line behind you at McDonald's who's way too talkative and kinda aggravating. Paired with a standout performance by Mark Duplass makes him an incredibly memorable villain. The plot itself is also wildly unpredictable, which is far too uncommon in movies like this.

It has so many tricks up its sleeve that it'll keep you on the edge of your seat, anticipating the next move that the movie will make.

Buffering and slow download speeds have never been more terrifying. Unfriended is so realistic that you feel like you're in the conversation the entire movie.

There were a lot of scenes in this where I was deeply uncomfortable because of those real-world fears.

In The Empire Strikes Back, the Galactic empire is on the hunt for Luke Skywalker and the rest of the Rebel Alliance. While Darth Vader is chasing Han Solo, Princess Leia and others across the galaxy, Luke studies the force under Jedi Master Yoda. Structurally, the film isn't as controlled as A New Hope, featuring long action scenes intertwined with dialog-heavy scenes of characterization, but that's an easily forgiven issue. The intense action scenes and darker plot make this a more involving film than its predecessor, and the young actors seemed a lot more confident in their roles. The Empire Strikes Back is an exciting film from start to finish, especially during the final thirty minutes when Luke faces off with Darth Vader.

Each movie has their own distinct style and can be enjoyed for different reasons. Of the four, The Martian is probably the most light-hearted and fun to watch, but don't let my words fool you. There are some insanely intense scenes to be found here. Based on the novel of the same name, The Martian is about astronaut Mark Watney who is presumed dead after a violent storm and left behind by the crew. He actually lives and must survive on Mars for months with meager supplies and his own ingenuity. Ridley Scott directed this film, and he was desperately in need of a success after the financial and commercial disappointments of Exodus: Gods and Kings and The Counsler. Luckily, he delivers one of his most spectacular movies to date that's capable of making you laugh and putting you on the edge of your seat. The final act of the film is particularly nail-biting, drawing comparisons to some of Gravity's most terrifying scenes. But what makes The Martian such a hit is its heart. Besides its great humor and amazing characters, it emphasizes the value and integrity of the human spirit. It may not go into the more philosophical implications of those themes too much, but when a movie is this well crafted, that hardly matters. The Martian is up there with the other great sci-fi epics of recent years, and it's certainly one of the best films of the year."" ]";2;7;2;5;0;0

It calls to mind recent arthouse horror movies like The Babadook and Goodnight Mommy, but The Witch is far scarier than those movies. It's a grim, perverse, and disturbing tale of religious paranoia among a crumbling family that will surely be remembered alongside the likes of Rosemary's Baby and The Omen. The Witch takes place in 17th century in Puritan-era New England. A family is excommunicated from their village and settles on the edge of a vast forest. Soon thereafter, their baby goes missing into the woods, and the family is torn apart by accusations of witchcraft, black magic and possession. From the first ten minutes, The Witch has a morose atmosphere and starts out with an incredibly disturbing scene. The initial shock is carried through the next few scenes which are dialog-heavy and slower, causing the dread to continue to the next horror. The terror never lets up and only amplifies as the plot progresses until the final 20 minutes are agonizing to watch. I could only vaguely tell you how the movie ended because I was watching through my fingers. It's perversely scary. The acting is fantastic from the entire cast, especially from the child actors.

The entire film is a cinematic masterpiece, and will leave you in silence upon finishing it, simply due to the realism and shock of it all. Steve McQueen has taken this true story and provided it with complete justice in a movie form, and he had no intentions of making light scenes. Each and every scene of this movie is full of emotion and the actors/actresses portray their feelings outstandingly well, I'd be very surprised if Chiwetel Ejiofor didn't win an award for playing the role of Solomon Northup. Unlike typical movies which are full of soundtracks and constantly changing scenes flashing before your eyes, this movie sets a very silent and extended form of scenery. There are moments in the film where all you are seeing is Solomon's face with nothing but silence, and it causes you to really read and understand the emotion in his face. The brutal scenes in which the slave's 'masters' are punishing them are also extremely powerful, and you as the audience are forced to witness prolonged scenes of horrific torture, the reality of it really does hit you hard. What I like about this film is the way it focuses so closely upon a handful of characters. The scope of the scenes never goes beyond Solomon, or the cotton farm in which the majority of the film is set in. By following the characters so closely, and portraying their emotions throughout, you develop an extremely sympathetic bond with the Solomon and his co-slaves, which very few movies I've seen can do. If you are reading this and haven't seen 12 Years a Slave, you must see it. The film does take a bit of stomach to watch, and you should also be prepared for the shock and reality of it, but in my eyes it is a must see. Personally, I think this is the sort of film which will go down in history as one of the greatest of all time, and the ending (which I wont spoil) is particularly moving."", """", ""10/10 for me, and I'm very picky about movies."" ]";3;4;3;1;0;0

The film is full of visual subtlety, lots of cool looking dark scenes, and best of all genuinely scary cool looking monsters. There are some moments in this film that have been burned into my memory, because they were so disturbing, and original. The ending is also a really awesome surprise, which is always awesome to have in a movie. Kind of reminds me of a big budget version of a really good Outer Limits episode."" ]";0;2;0;2;0;0

Post-WWII, a USA naval veteran inadvertently hops on a yacht one night and is hooked on a cult named “The Cause”, lead by its eloquent yet irascible master, while being an avid follower of the master, his perennial booze-abusive, sex-driven, violent nature enables himself to be the soul needs salvation, a side-kick and a role model, it also encroaches his mental realm and life orientation, eventually challenges his loyalty with The Cause and the master. PTA’s trademark roving and tracking long-shots maintain as engaging as any directors could ever achieve, not obtrusive but impeccably tally with the storytelling; the retro-soaked palette authentically establishes a mystic aura of the inexplicable internal mechanism of how our emotion rises and falls, attended by a rhythmic score from Jonny Greenwood."", """", ""Joaquin Phoenix gives me a first impression of Michael Shannon (whose TAKE SHELTER 2011, 9/10 is among my top pick of 2011), in a far gaunter figure, he embodies his character so devotedly and destructively, it is a privilege to appreciate his hunchback stance, the unique way when he speaks (English words evade me now, help?), his exuberance, his furore, his confusion and his determination.

personal-shopper;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;Apr  2, 2017;"[ ""After unequivocally loving Olivier Assayas' 2014 effort, Clouds of Sils Maria, his follow-up is a lot tougher of a nut to crack. Part-thriller, part-horror, part-mood piece, Personal Shopper truly evades definition. It operates at a safe distance from the viewer and refuses to be defined. By the end of the film, what is real and what is not real is really next to impossible to pin down. Personally, I have a variety of working theories, but whether or not any of them are actually accurate is another matter in and of itself. What is clear, however, is that this is a film about grief, identity, and mortality. Above all, it is a thriller that sets out to unsettle its audiences and make them think. To do so, Assayas' film is purposefully complex, dense, and tonally off. Even the editing, with many scenes ending abruptly and fading to black, is used to throw off the audience and make us squirm. Of course, this has the by-product of making the film appear to be lacking satisfaction. In many ways, however, this merely mirrors the issues of Maureen (Kristen Stewart) after losing her twin brother Lewis. Complicated, distant, and forever denying viewer access to its idiosyncrasies, it is no wonder that Personal Shopper has divided audiences."", ""One of the most obvious themes that Assayas introduces into the film is grief. Working as a personal shopper for model Kyra (Nora von Waldstätten) to support herself while also operating as a medium for the couple set to move into Lewis' old home, Maureen is constantly looking for a sign. Before he died, the two had promised to leave the other a sign. Whoever died first had to let the other know they were in the afterlife. Waiting around in Paris for Lewis to come give her that sign, she encounters a ghost that is most definitely not Lewis and also begins to receive mysterious text messages from an unknown number. While she is shaken, she approaches every situation where a ghost may be present with the same question: Are you Lewis? She cannot get him off of her mind and is constantly seeking to find out if he is alright and at peace. Assayas' film shows how grief can control one's way of life to the point that she refuses to meet up with boyfriend Gary (Ty Olwin) in Oman for a vacation. Instead, she does a job she hates for a woman she hates just to justify staying in Paris. In essence, she is a prisoner of her grief, which is not an original theme by any means (The Babadook being a recent example), but is well-executed in the film. Assayas injects incredible tension and fear as we wait to find out if the ghosts and noises she encounters are truly Lewis or some other being."", ""However, I have my doubts that Maureen is actually a medium. Whether Lewis was or not is unclear, but towards the end of the film, Maureen remarks how Lewis was always more in tune with that and she usually just copied him. It is entirely plausible that Maureen is not a medium at all. Rather, she is merely a girl suffering from a lost identity due to the shared one she had with Lewis. As he was her twin, it is possible she is trying a route he had taken in order to reach him. However, it does not work and either she meets unfriendly forces or she imagines them all. The latter, however, seems most likely with how awful she is at detecting presences. She notices obvious things in the walls or glasses breaking, but never seems to aware a ghost is with her until it is literally right on top of her. If she were a medium, it would stand to reason that she would be better at identifying when they are near. Furthermore, the ghostly text messages she receives where the sender claims to always be around her and sees what she is doing and wearing, certainly hint that there is a ghost around her. Possibly Lewis, the sender does seem to be a bit odd, but largely harmless for Maureen. However, what is clear is that either Maureen is not a medium or she is an entirely dreadful one, making it unlikely she ever actually encounters ghosts. Rather, it is merely a machination of her mind used to cope with the loss of Lewis in the only way he knew how."", ""One of the most important things that this ghost texter allows her to confront, however, is her sense of identity. Now, this is where this interpretation may lose some people, but I warn you that this is a film that demands multiple views. Coming off of one viewing, it is entirely possible I am off base here. Yet, there are three possible routes to take in regards to Maureen's sense of identity. One is the most logical one based on the film. Through encouraging her to try on Kyra's clothing, the sender allows her to try on a new personality. After expressing that she does not want to be herself, but is unsure who she wants to be, the sender allows her to try out new personalities to find one that fits her."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0
a-ghost-story;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;Oct  5, 2017;"[ ""Heading into A Ghost Story, one cannot be blamed for assuming it is an examination of grief. With a young husband (Casey Affleck) dying early on and wife (Rooney Mara) mourning his loss, eating pie, and trying to move on without him, it is easy to see how the film is about grief. Yet, in equal measure, it is a film about memory, time, purpose, music, stories, and every little detail that makes life so eternal, so essential, and universal. It is a film about grief shown through the lens of an unexpected protagonist - the ghost under a sheet - who traverses time, space, people, and location. Powerful, poignant, and silently accomplished, A Ghost Story is a rousing return to form for director David Lowery after working for Disney last year. In this low-key, gorgeous, and powerful film, Lowery re-establishes himself as the heir apparent to Terrence Malick's cinematic poetry throne."", ""Silently sewing together images, Lowery's camera frequently finds stunning images. From the very beginning, shots of Affleck's ghost walking through open fields to get back home with the sun peaking over the horizon, the ghost lurking in the background with Mara in the foreground, or the shot of light pouring in as the home is destroyed, A Ghost Story is a film with stunning visuals. This was very much the case with Lowery's prior effort Ain't Them Bodies Saints - which also starred Affleck and Mara - and it is nice to see him return to this gorgeous style. However, compared to that film, Lowery is much less reliant on the beauty of the outdoors to create stunning imagery in A Ghost Story. Rather, he now relies upon drab gray and brown interiors, dark shadows, and a largely gloomy home that is fashioned as a prison cell for this ghost for the rest of eternity until he finds what he has been looking for all this time. Dark, ominous, and spooky, this locale is one that would work for a horror film, but rather, Lowery uses it as a place for existential horror. This ghost is doomed to stay here until he can get the note left behind by Mara that he wants to retrieve, yet he is unable to break through the painted wall to reach the note. Trapped, lonely, and solemn, the ghost's existence is one of little joy, pain (especially when Mara tries to move on), and anger at how he has been so easily forgotten."", ""However, what is perhaps most interesting is how the aspect ratio communicates so much. Lowery himself has stated it was to make the film more claustrophobic to show how trapped the ghost is in this home, but that is just scratching the surface. With a squareish frame and rounded edges with drab colors, the film often looks like an old photograph. This is particularly pertinent due to the film's thoughts regarding memories and the little pieces of ourselves that we leave behind. Being remembered, our memories, and our brief time on Earth after which we are forgotten forever, are all constantly on the mind of A Ghost Story throughout. Mara leaving little notes of things she likes in houses she moves from, the quiet mourning of her husband, and a party guest speaking about memory and Beethoven, all exemplify this element of the film. Yet, what is abundantly clear in A Ghost Story is that time does not matter. It will advance, things will be left behind, people die, and people move on to other places. In the end, the only thing that does matter are the little pieces of ourselves we leave in the hearts and souls of those we touch. As Affleck silently lingers in the background with Mara eating a piece of pie, this fact is felt. She does not need to say anything, nor does he. Both miss one another and it is not because they existed, were in that home, or were even because they were married. Rather, it is because they both touched one another's lives and, now, circumstance and a freak accident have taken them apart from one another. Instead of holding one another, they now are left wallow in the solitude and thickness of the air in the home as they try to soothe the hole in their hearts."", ""With a minimal script that often amounts to a character standing stationary for a period of time to the ambitious time traveling finale, A Ghost Story is a film that is nearly impossible to not compare to the work of Malick. Yet, it is not just in the style and ambition that Lowery manages to capture the feeling of Malick's best works, but also in the feelings they emote. The best Malick films, such as The Tree of Life, are ambitious and show life from the very beginning to the present day with a silent, melodic, and poetic flow to the proceedings. A Ghost Story is very much the same way. Instead of being a typical narrative film, A Ghost Story is often best described as visual poetry. Through small suggestions, such as what is on the paper (it is the quote from the book that Affleck knocks off the shelf and Mara reads for sure), or through this gorgeous mosaic of images that, on their own, often communicate every emotion and purpose perfectly, Lowery"" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0
the-big-sick;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;Jul  8, 2017;"[ ""In writing, it is said that it is best to write what you know. That way, you can bring that authentic and real emotion, feeling, and touch to the events depicted. Perhaps no recent film has better embodied this than The Big Sick. Though directed by Michael Showalter, this is really Kumail Nanjiani and Emily Gordon's show. The married pair of screenwriters who sat down and put the story of their meeting, Emily's illness, the issues regarding a Pakistani immigrant and American girl dating, and their eventual reunion. Wherever they may take liberties with their own story to make it more cinematic - if these moments exist - does nothing to stamp out the way in which the film deftly handles a variety of issues. Whatever bridge is tries to cross, it does so running. Finding the comedy in joy, sadness, pain, rejection, and anxiety, The Big Sick is often a profound and moving experience, but is always a thoroughly enjoyable one. How it manages to become this is because of one simple fact: Nanjiani and Gordon were there, so they know how it all felt."", ""Kumail Nanjiani is this romantic comedy with Zoe Kazan starring as Kumail's real wife, Emily. A Pakistani immigrant, Kumail is a stand-up comedian who must cope with his family's strict religious beliefs and fervent desire for him to meet a Pakistani girl. Along the way, he meets cute with Emily and the two quickly hit it off. In portraying the issues Kumail has with his family and how it impacts his relationship, The Big Sick benefits greatly from being written by those who experienced the feeling. As a result of Kumail's family, their relationship is highly complex. If they stay together, then Kumail is exiled from his family and Emily feels remorse for being the cause behind him losing his family. However, if they keep their relationship hidden as Kumail intends, then Emily is hurt as it makes it feel as though he does not want her in the way that she wants him. It is a slippery slope and one that must be confronted. Having everyone walk away happy is likely improbable due to the steep barrier of culture keeping them apart. Worsening the situation is all of the little intricacies of which they remain blissfully unaware, highlighted by Kumail having to constantly explain arranged marriage to Emily and those around them. This gulf in culture, no matter how Americanized Kumail has become, will always be there and must be approached cautiously by both sides."", ""Where the film really soars, however, is when Emily is not even there. Zoe Kazan is fantastic, but the film becomes quite profound when Kumail is thrust into a situation where he must cope with Emily's illness and meeting her parents. Terry (Ray Romano) and Beth (Holly Hunter) rush from North Carolina to care for their daughter as she fights off a mystery illness and also meet Kumail for the first time. Reeling from the two breaking up due to Kumail's unwillingness to lose his family and Emily's unwillingness to make him lose his family, it is a rather awkward situation for him with Beth knowing all of the sordid details, including Kumail's lying and dishonesty regarding his family. Thus, tensions run quite high initially before they come to bond over one thing: Emily. Their love, care, fear, and pain, that is shared with each ebb and flow of her illness and the frustration felt when the doctors are clueless, brings them together. They reach deep within themselves to overcome this and the writing by Nanjiani and Gordon is raw, emotional, and powerful. This area is perhaps mostly driven by Nanjiani considering Gordon was not there, but the film nonetheless captures the emotions of everybody involved brilliantly. Watching a loved one fight an illness is a truly helpless feeling, worsened when doctors are unsure why it is happening (which is always). The Big Sick never feels exploitative, is smartly written in this arena, and captures both the light moments that bring a smile to your face - Beth showing old high school photos of Emily in her \""goth phase\"" to Kumail - and the shared sadness when the news is particularly hard. All of this culminates into the greatest release: Emily overcoming his illness."", ""Though a true story and obviously going to end up with Kumail and Emily being together, the film smartly never falls into the trap of rushing them back together when she overcomes her illness. As she fights, the film lays the groundwork for this in its inclusion of Terry's infidelity. It is clear before this reveal that Terry and Beth are constantly at one another's throats. In hearing it from Terry, he was forgiven by her but she never let go of it and never was able to overcome her hurt from his transgression. For his part, he still hates himself for what he did to her. It is a slow process of healing for their relationship with both sleeping in separate beds. Taking years of healing, The Big Sick sums it up quite neatly with Beth coming back into Terry's bed, but it highlights the slow build-up."" ]";2;4;2;2;0;0
colossal;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;Apr 15, 2017;"[ ""Anybody who sees the trailer and expects a monster movie is set to be disappointed, which seems to be a constant theme among those disappointed: they expected something different. Whether they expected more of a monster movie or a comedic take on one, Colossal winds up missing the mark on both, simply because it is not necessarily either. Using elements of monster movies and comedy to tell its tale, Colossal is a genre bending film with a character study core as it examines the life of its lead character, her problems, and how she became who she is today. To do this, it does use a monster terrifying Seoul, but it is merely a device through which we learn about our protagonist and the people in her life. Smartly written with top-notch acting all around, Colossal is a surprisingly satisfying film that will make you laugh, but also  terrify, thrill, and entertain you with everything in its arsenal. It is, essentially, the swiss army knife of films. This, naturally, has its limitations, but writer/director Nacho Vigalondo deftly blending everything together into a cohesive and highly rewarding film is a practically miraculous achievement."", ""Colossal tells the story of Gloria (Anne Hathaway). An out-of-work alcoholic, Gloria abuses the trust of boyfriend Tim (Dan Stevens) and makes a mockery of his hospitality in light of her financial status. Tim opts to show her some tough love by kicking her out and breaking up with her. Returning to her small hometown, Gloria pitches her tent in her parents' empty house, which is being rented out at the moment. While there, she runs into old elementary school friend Oscar (Jason Sudeikis) and, while paling around with him and his friends, scores a job as a bartender at the bar owned by Oscar. The only hitch in this newfound success? At 8:05 in South Korea, if Gloria walks through a playground near her home, she will appear as a huge monster and terrorize the people of Seoul. As we quickly learn, Oscar has the same affliction, appearing as a large robot. Becoming a global phenomenon, the film finds great comedy and excitement in the hysteria by showing the internet's reaction to the insanity, as well as the sheer bloody carnage created by Gloria and Oscar without any intent on their part."", ""Yet, these kaijus are merely a gateway into the psyches of Colossal's protagonists. Peering into why both Gloria and Oscar are undeniably broken people, the film borders on becoming a thriller at moments, as well as being a fully-fledged character study. Tracing their current predicament with an event 25 years prior, which was also the first time the monster was seen in Seoul, Colossal shows just how deeply unhappy and self-loathing its characters are. A woman who got fired from her job as a writer and apparently faced some harassment online over it, Gloria feels inadequate and depressed. Fighting to be heard and stand tall as an individual, Gloria feels personally attacked whenever things go wrong or a situation turns sour, in part because she lacks the confidence in herself to really follow through on anything. As a result, she drowns her sorrows in a bottle in order to forget her past and allow her to not be consumed with the crushing weight of being a failure after having so many expectations placed upon her after getting out of her small town."", ""On the other side, Oscar is a much darker character. Deeply disturbed, obsessed with Gloria, and caught in a vicious cycle of self-loathing that sees him exact his self-hatred on the world in order to vent, Oscar is a surprisingly dark and terrifying man. Gloria is taken aback by this, but Colossal quickly establishes just how much he envies her for having achieved so much by simply leaving the town. Pointing to the death of his mother - of whom he has a photo with her face scratched out - as the event that made Oscar turn, Colossal shows how Oscar seems to play Gloria for all of the inadequacy her feels and the sense that he is a complete failure. Lashing out at her and his friends, Oscar runs everybody off purely because of the violent and passionate hate he feels for himself."", ""As a result of this characterization, we see how destructive their personalities and situations are. Though Gloria and Oscar suffer from their own issues, the people most impacted by their problems are those around them. They are greatly destructive people, both literally and figuratively squashing every opportunity, friendship, and relationship, set before them purely because they cannot get out of their own way and are consumed with their self-loathing. If they simply looked down and watched what they were stepping on, they may be able to catch themselves and stop before causing too much damage. However, like a kaiju, they simply stomp about and ruin every life they encounter along the way. A smart usage of kaijus to personify the inner demons of a person and the damage it can cause for those they love and hold dear, Colossal handles the issue in the proper way"" ]";1;3;1;2;0;0

It is a calling for people that are missing something and want to find something in those jungles that is more than a city of gold. What they hope to find is unknown to even them and is one that will undoubtedly forever change their life."", ""Percy Fawcett (Charlie Hunnam) was one such man. Initially sent to Bolivia on behalf of the Royal Geographical Society and British Army in order to end a border dispute between Bolivia and Brazil over where the border actually is between the two, Fawcett quickly becomes obsessed with the Amazonian jungle. In his initial mission to find the source of a river known to the British that holds the key to where the border lies, he stumbles across pottery and a carving in a tree. Around him is nothing but jungle, except for these small trinkets. Upon returning to Britain, he immediately calls for his return to find a lost city he is calling “Zed”. Despite the fact that his wife Nina (Sienna Miller) is pregnant with their second child and his son Jack (soon to be Tom Holland) does not remember him, Percy believes he must go back to the jungle. With the backing of a few investors, he does set out to find this lost city, returning with Corporal Henry Costin (Robert Pattinson), Corporal Arthur Manley), and explorer James Murray (Angus Macfayden). Upon there, illness and a loss of rations prevent them from completing the journey. Finally, years later after spending time in France for World War I, he returns with son Jack to complete his journey for this lost city."", ""However, in spite of its apparent set-up as a film about a man embarking on a life’s journey to find a city and throwing away his family in the process, The Lost City of Z is mostly a character study. Percy Fawcett is a man who has made Major in the British Army at the beginning of the film, but without a medal. He has received some distinctions in the past, but is the only man to have the rank of Major without a medal. Compounded by the fact that his father was a drunk with an infamous reputation that ruined the Fawcett name, Percy first accepts the surveying mission to Bolivia in an effort to restore his name. Calls from Britain for him to return immediately due to adverse conditions on his first trip are met with stubbornness from Percy, who insists on completing the mission given to them nonetheless. Though he loves his wife Nina and loves his children, he is on a search to find himself in this Amazonian jungle. He feels destiny calling him with even a psychic he visits in the trenches of World War I telling him that his soul will never rest until he finds what he is looking for in the jungle. To Percy, this means the lost city. If he just finds the city, he will be okay and will stop hearing the voice in his head to run. However, what he is running to is an illusion. There has been a possible city found there in this century, but it is not what was calling Fawcett. His call what one of self-identity. Who is he? He has no rank. His father was a drunk. All he has is this city and it is the only accomplishment he could ever dream of having that will define his destiny and leave a mark on the world. If he could find this city, he would be remembered and revered for his bravery. If he fails, he is seen as a crazy person who fell for the old “El Dorado” mirage that explorers and conquistadors had fallen prey to throughout time."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0
the-lego-batman-movie;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;Feb 14, 2017;"[ ""Fast paced, frenetic, and kinetic, The Lego Batman Movie is another piece of product placement for Lego, Bed, Bath & Beyond, and Pennysaver, that works incredibly well. Though fast paced, it never annoys, while providing bright colors and fun sequences for the target child audience. But, in this spate of incredible energy, The Lego Batman Movie touches on important themes of teamwork, togetherness, and family, that should have a profound impact on children. For adults, the dirtier jokes and the constant fan service with Batman, and the critique of DC films (\""brooding\"" as a Batman trait, mocking the premise of Suicide Squad) will more than provide enough entertainment. Above all, however, the film truly strikes a sweet spot from being self-referential and corny without slipping into becoming annoying a la last year's Deadpool. This is a self-aware superhero satire done right with funny jokes, good action, and tremendous animation."", ""With Will Arnett anchoring the film with a hysterically selfish and narcissistic take on Batman, Arnett finds some great pieces to the character when he is not just spitting punch lines. Though the punch lines work, the film would tire quickly if it were just a barrage of jokes. Rather, via Batman, the film finds a heart akin to a Pixar film. Lonely and caught in a constant spiral of self-loathing that culminates with a new Batman film being released, the character lives a life of solitude. At times vulnerable, but always lashing out as a result of his inner anger, Arnett does well to play a man who is self-aware. He knows he is alone, but his vanity and pride do not allow him to admit it out loud. His obsession over his abs is vain, yes, but also heavily compensating for how inadequate of a person he feels like without a family to call his own. Though Alfred (Ralph Fiennes) is there for him, he is so blind for self-hatred, this point is lost on him. As a side bar, Fiennes is a brilliant selection for Alfred and does tremendously in the role."", ""Though the film explains its themes of loneliness, family, and teamwork with no subtlety, it never feels preachy because it is a kids movie. Though the parents get it, the kids do need Ellie Kemper's Phyllis, guardian of the Phantom Zone, the explain to us what makes people good or bad and how people can change. On-the-nose, the film never suffers or feels hokey, rather it is a good time for the adults to calm down and relax from the frenetic pace of the film."", ""The frenetic pace of the film is not a constant though. Some of the best scenes in the film are ones highlighting Batman's loneliness. An extended shot that has to be somewhere near a minute long or more (a lifetime in this film) of Batman just sitting in his indoor pool eating lobster is absolutely hysterical. Him warming up the lobster and getting his mail also hits comedy highs for its critique of the mundanity of life. It highlights just how plain his life is, but makes him so relatable to the audience and shows that, no matter who you are, the Pennysaver winds up in the mailbox and you always hit the wrong numbers on the microwave the first time. The simple comedy of this film is a pleasure to watch unfold and, though not revolutionary, it is incredible fun and really works in the film with great comedic delivery and director Chris McKay willing to take his time with jokes."", ""That said, the film's most fervent energy comes into the form of constant references. A who's who of properties that Warner Bros or Lego have their hands in with villains coming left, right, and center, from the 80s, 90s, and 00s, the film is a nerd's dream. Much of the hilarity comes the sheer number of villains introduced - both from Batman's world and others - as well as those that are not real, but included anyways as a punchline. Again, very simple humor, but it is great service to the adults in the crowd who will get the references and enjoy seeing them portrayed in this format."", ""Plot-wise, the film is in service of its themes. Naturally, one must fail on their own to realize they need help. Yet, the film's interesting action in Arkham Asylum and the city of Gotham, as well as an interesting take on the \""end the world\"" desire of villains of all kinds, the film finds great entertainment from its storyline. It may not be revolutionary, but director Chris McKay does a great job capturing the action and finding innovative ways to utilize the use of legos in the battle and in the aftermath of action sequences (fire). Interestingly, the film also shows the need for evil as the presence of evil ensures the rise of good to overcome evil. In this way, the character of the Joker (Zach Galifianakis) is used incredibly well and his actions in regards to the plot work incredibly well with this recurring theme."", ""Featuring a stellar voice cast, The Lego Batman Movie is a terrifically animated affair that is pure energy."" ]";1;1;1;0;0;0
a-united-kingdom;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;Feb 19, 2017;"[ ""Though a safe historical film, director Amma Asante's A United Kingdom never ceases to be anything less than powerful, riveting, and entirely rousing. Telling the real story of Seretse Khama (David Oyelowo), the Prince of now-Botswana, and his love of Englishwoman Ruth Williams (Rosamund Pike), A United Kingdom shows how they were kept apart. Rejected by Seretse's uncle and current regent of the nation, the British government (both the Labor and Conservative parties), and apartheid-in-progress South Africa (a key British ally and neighbor to Botswana), the marriage is in trouble. Exiled from Botswana and unable to return, Seretse must fight to be able to claim the crown that is rightfully is, return to the people that he loves, and to secure Botswana's future with the prospect of diamond mining occurring on the nation's land."", ""A tale of injustice and racism, Seretse and Ruth fall in love in England and wish to head to Botswana, where Seretse is set to become Chief/King of his people. However, the South Africans - in the process of installing apartheid - do not want it and threaten to stop following British rule if they allow the marriage. A pawn in large political matters of colonialism and rule, A United Kingdom shows that people have always been caught in the crosshairs of politics and those politicians have always lied. Though they recognize allowing them to marry is the right choice, the fear of the South Africans is far too much to let either the Labor or Conservative parties act on his injustice. They even go so far as lying to Seretse and his legal team about the contents of a report into the situation in Botswana, claiming it is on the brink of civil war because Seretse's uncle refuses to accept Ruth and pass the crown onto Seretse. Though Seretse's people and sister accept Ruth whole heartedly, their battle is one that must be fought uphill."", ""In crafting its romance, A United Kingdom is often beautiful. It borders on cliff notes at times with how quickly it goes through it, but it works incredibly well all the same. Romantic, nostalgia, and taboo, director Amma Asante's film captures all of the dirty looks, gestures, and actions they get as a result of their love, while also developing their love. The two go hand-in-hand and it shows that the hatred they face only serves to strengthen their bond together. Unwilling to bend to the wills of the families or the government, the two are defiant, strong-willed, and entirely in love with one another. Listening to other people tell them what to do is hardly an option."", ""However, A United Kingdom is a film far more in line with a political drama. Showing shots in parliament of them debating the issue and the bureaucracy that stops them from being able to be together in Botswana, the film plays out like a political film, not a romantic one. The romance is there and you can tell the connection between them only grows due to the great chemistry between Oyelowo and Pike, but the emphasis here is the politics. Asante uses the film to show how governments do what they know is wrong for political reasons. Though perhaps quite obvious to anybody, A United Kingdom, by first establishing the romance, makes it feel personal and intimate. It is as if the government is not letting us be with our spouse, making the injustice really hit home. How can they deny the love these two people have for one another? How can they bend to the will of a deeply racist country looking? How can they be so greedy, anticipating that diamonds will be found in Botswana? All are obvious, but truly are drilled home perfectly in the film and the end result is a greatly dramatic and oddly thrilling film that wraps you up in the politics of the situation and benefits from it throughout."", ""That said, the star here is David Oyelowo. The climactic moment from the trailer when  he declares he loves his people and land, but also loves his wife is just as rousing and powerful in the film. Oyelowo is an incredibly under-recognized actor, in spite of his stirring turn in Selma as Martin Luther King, Jr. Here, as Seretse Khama, he finds much of the same inspiration and power that he had as King, playing a man who used as a political pawn by entities that had no business dictating affairs in his home country. Oyelowo is a brilliant speaker and delivers his lines with resonance and strength, making him an easy sell as the inspirational political figure. As his wife, Pike is far more reserved, but works on an emotional-level. Showing the hurt in her eyes and face from the suffering her family must go through because of prejudice, Pike may not be nearly as good as Oyelowo here, but she is still very good in her own right."", ""A United Kingdom may not appeal to everyone, as it is largely what would be expected. A powerful tale of injustice, romance, and politics, director Amma Asante does this true story incredible justice in retelling it in this film."" ]";1;1;1;0;0;0
a-cure-for-wellness;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;Jun  7, 2017;"[ ""A Cure for Wellness was a film destined for disaster. A film set in a sanitarium dedicated to providing a \""cure\"" to its wealthy patients, the film was immediately pinned as being a similar film to Shutter Island. With its mansion-setting that holds various secrets, a similar production design, and a protagonist running around reassuring everybody that he is not a patient, it is obvious why many critics and filmgoers drew the comparison. Yet, even if the film does try and hint towards this delusion at times, it is always a distraction for Lockhart (Dane DeHaan). It is not the truth. The audience knows it throughout and he knows it throughout. Instead, this is a film straight out of the late 1990s dressed up to be a psychological thriller set in a place with many dark secrets."", ""Using a horror film setup for its execution, the film is set on top of a hill in a small village in Switzerland. Introducing us to Lockhart, an ambitious and smarmy financial services salesman, the film shows him to be dispatched to the sanitarium to find his company's CEO who has disappeared to the sanitarium right before a big merger. Now, with rumors of the merger being in trouble, the stock price is tanking and the CEO needs to come back and sign off on the merger before there is nothing left to merge. Upon arriving, Lockhart quickly determines that this is a place with secrets. Filled to the brim with rich patients who left their lives of seeming luxury to find a cure to become well, the place is run by Dr. Heinreich Volmer (Jason Isaacs). Held there, along with the patients, is a \""special case\"" named Hannah (Mia Goth). With classic horror film stories of a Baron who used to live in the mansion and similarly sought a cure for his sister/wife's infertility by running experiments on peasant villagers, only for the whole mansion and his sister/wife to be burned by the villagers, the film is immediately eerie and unsettling. Unrolling this information throughout, it becomes all the more apparent that this is still happening today for a very similar purpose."", ""The film draws comparisons to Shutter Island through this setup about a mysterious old mansion and through a line said by Lockhart's mother early on in the film. Handing him a new ballerina she has sculpted, she tells him that this ballerina is special and different from the others she has made. Compared to the others, this one's eyes are closed and is dreaming. This, as we quickly learn, is Hannah. Both are not just described as special, but both wear blue and are in a world where they are not aware of the fact that they are dreaming and deluded. With scenes of awful treatments and mysteries lying around every corner, director Gore Verbinski cultivates a classic asylum-esque feeling to the film that constantly keeps the audience on edge and uncertain as to what lies around the corner. These terrible experiments and the pain endured by Lockhart and others kept hostage in the sanitarium is unspeakable and why the film has earned a reputation for being entirely messed up. Yet, either it is not nearly as messed up as billed or my tastes in film are more messed up than previously imagined."", ""The film further distracts the audience with more parallels to Shutter Island that attempt to distract the viewer from realizing the truth behind the narrative. These distractions include instances where the doctors track down Lockhart and Hannah in the village and convince the similarly medicated police chief that Lockhart is delusional, scenes of \""hallucinations\"" and dreams of eels everywhere, and Lockhart himself coming to believe he is delusional. Yet, the audience constantly knows better. Even when he begins to doubt his own mind, we saw him in the beginning as a regular guy in a financial services company tasked with coming to Switzerland. There should be no delusion here due to this fact, further underscoring how everything at the sanitarium is a massive cover-up, right? Yes and no. The sanitarium is both a terrifying and exploitative scam, but Lockhart is also delusional."", ""This is where the film breaks free and is why it is unfortunate for it to be nothing more than a Shutter Island rehash. Instead, it is far more apt to compare the film to the films of 1999 such as Fight Club, American Beauty, or Office Space. Perhaps, on the surface, this seems an odd comparison, but thematically it is the exact same film. Opening with a scene of a man named Morris working late at night and suffering a heart attack, Verbinski shows us shots of the man's family in a photo on the shelf. With him working late, it is clear that he is largely unable to spend much time with his family. Lockhart's own father, who also worked for the same financial services company that Lockhart now works for, took his own life after being ruined at work. Lockhart, until he goes to Switzerland, is always working. Those who use the sanitarium ran to go get the \""cure\"" after feeling unfulfilled in their lives of work."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0
paterson;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;Feb 25, 2017;"[ ""A slice of life film, Paterson depicts one week (Monday to Sunday) in the life of Paterson (Adam Driver) who lives in Paterson, New Jersey with his girlfriend Laura (Golshifteh Farahani), his dog Marvin, works as a bus driver for the city, and goes to a bar run by Doc (Barry Shabaka Henley). Aside from the weekend, his days are relatively the same. He wakes up, gets breakfast, goes to work, has a conversation with a fellow employee who's life is in shambles, he drives, he goes home, he has dinner, he walks Marvin, he goes to the bar, and then repeat. Yet, much like life, things change every time. To the untrained eye, particularly when it is your own eye, life barely changes from day-to-day. Capturing this beauty and showing how it changes, Paterson is a simple and down-to-earth film that plays like a poem about life and all of its odd idiosyncrasies."", ""Paterson is, above all, a film about people. That is the biggest change from the day-to-day. Every morning, Paterson wakes up next to Laura. Every morning, their sleeping position is different. Every morning, he eats breakfast. Every morning, he is eating something different, sitting somewhere new, or the dog is somewhere new. Every morning, he goes to work. Every day, he encounters new people, new sights in the city, new conversations, and new incidents. Every day, he goes home. Every day, Laura made something new for dinner, painted something, or purchased something new. Every day, he walks to the bar with Melvin. Every day, he sees somebody new or has a conversation with a stranger. Every day, he goes to the bar. Every day, he sees new people who are new or familiar faces to him and the conversations or situations are different. Though, on the surface, Paterson is a film about seven days that just repeat themselves like Groundhog Day, each day is vibrantly different. It is a film that celebrates the mundane nature of life, but also the subtle changes that make each day feel new. It is not merely a world defined by the fact that the sun rises every morning and sets every evening. The times of the sunrise and sunset even change each day, symbolic of the slight and practically unnoticeable change of each day. We have our routines, especially Melvin, but things will not always go to plan and things will often change from the day-to-day. Jarmusch's picture is tribute to that and a simple and structurally unique poem to that simplicity."", ""Beautifully acted by Adam Driver, the role is incredibly reserved as he plays the quite and meditative Paterson. Constantly writing in his secret notebook of poems, he writes about simple things like a box of matches. He finds the poetry in life and pens poems based upon that simple beauty. Largely not emotive, he is a man that simply goes through life and likes what he likes and what he likes most is poetry. Yet, his reserved nature even applies to his love. He does not read his poems to his girlfriend, he does identify himself as an aspiring poet to people he meets, and he does not want to share his poems with the world. Writing the poems is enough for him, nothing more and nothing less. He is content with his life in Paterson, driving a bus, living with his girlfriend, and going to the bar. His poetry, as it stands, is all he wants it to be. Every inch of his life, even his girlfriend and her obsession with black-and-white, is what he wants it to be. His aspirations are to wake up as himself the next day and to do what he likes, even if it does not conform with the aspirations and dreams of society."", ""Yet, what sets Paterson apart is its complete lack of cinematic aspirations. In many ways, Jarmusch's film is like Paterson himself. As Laura pushes him to release his poems, he half-heartedly promises to make copies of the poems. Whenever the audience thinks the film is setting up something via foreshadowing or about to reach a scene of unspeakable tension, the film refuses. With a street tough warning Paterson about how Melvin might get dog jacked, Paterson talking to an aspiring rapper who seems oddly intrigued by the dog, Everett (William Jackson Harper) bringing a gun to the bar, and Paterson's bus breaking down, it feels like the film is constantly foreshadowing or introducing palpable drama. The most common fear is regarding the dog and that fear could be felt in the theater. Left outside the bar as Paterson drinks and pals around, we are constantly left with the belief that Melvin will be stolen. But, inevitably, the screen fades to black and he begins the next day next to Laura in bed. There is even a scene where the door is open and Melvin runs out, but it is shown to be merely part of his routine as he immediately scampers back in. Jarmusch even openly mocks his audience in regards to the bus incident. With it breaking down due to an electical problem, passengers immediately ask if it will blow up. The film seems to play into this by having Paterson tell everybody to stay a good distance away from the bus."" ]";2;2;2;0;0;0
a-monster-calls;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;May  2, 2017;"[ ""Guillermo del Toro's protege, Juan Antonio Bayona, continues to deliver high-quality emotional gut punches with his latest work, A Monster Calls. An unfortunate box office failure earlier this year, the film is a heart wrenching tale of a boy named Conor (Lewis MacDougall) whose mother Lizzie (Felicity Jones) is dying of cancer. With a hard-nosed grandmother Mrs. Chandler (Sigourney Weaver) accompanying them and providing Conor with what will be his new home, a neglectful father who lives in a different country (Toby Kebbell), and bullies at school making his life hell, Conor is visited by a monster (Liam Neeson). Arriving to teach him three lessons in life and to elicit Conor's darkest secret from him, A Monster Calls is a film about a young boy learning to cope with the loss of his mother, his own anger for how he is behaving, and how he desperately tries to grab control of something around him. Unfortunately, with everyone else collapsing all around him, there are practically no alleys to turn down but the one opened by the monster. Moving, heart-wrenching, and an absolute tearjerker, A Monster Calls is yet another score for Bayona's brand of emotional cinema set against fantastical backgrounds (The Orphanage)."", ""While the film's depiction of a mother dying from cancer and how it impacts everyone around her is undoubtedly manipulative, Bayona picks at the viewer's heart strings so effectively and with such authentic emotion, that we hardly ever notice his hand. Gracefully put together and nimbly jumping between its hard-hitting themes about loss, grieving, and overcoming the death of a loved one, with its more adventurous and creative look at coping with a fairy tale watercolor backdrop, A Monster Calls is an excellently written and directed film that really finds a way to keep its eye on the prize. No matter what happens in the film, this is a film about a boy facing the toughest thing he has ever faced. His denial that it is happening. His rage about it happening. And finally, his acceptance that it is happening and looking ahead to how to heal and grow from the experience."", ""Visiting with the monster everyday at 12:07 AM, Conor must face the deepest secret he has within him and one that is all too relatable: he wants it to be over. The agony. The waiting. The pain. The anger. The suffering. The anticipation. Yes, for it to be over means that his mother Lizzie must die, but he wants it to be over. In the end, we all know this feeling. It is, honestly, one of the tougher elements of coping with the loss of a loved one, because it is tinged with regret. A Monster Calls demonstrates this perfectly with how this anger and guilt felt by Conor over how he wants this stage of his life to end manifests itself in his everyday life. From hating his grandmother and destroying her house, to rejecting his father out of anger, and to beating up his bully and sending him to the hospital, Conor copes with rage. Yet, though the expression it outwardly, it is focused entirely on himself. He loves his mother. The two have been best friends for as long as he can remember. She cuddles with him watching movies and when he is scared at night. She taught him to paint. The two are inseparable, but she must go now and he cannot accept that he wants her to go just for him to stop feeling the pain of waiting for her to go. It is a conflicting feeling and one that can destroy even the strongest of adults, let alone a teenager."", ""Yet, he must learn to not just overcome the impending death of his mother, but his own anger at himself. Through the stories, he learns that people are not all good or all bad, that believing something can happen is the first step to it actually happening, and that crying out for help is a sign of strength and one that will get him noticed, but to be noticed is not everything; one must be able to recognize their own pain themselves as well before it gets out of hand. It is alright to be mad and to let yourself be heard, but you cannot let it consume your entire being. Even worse, you cannot let that anger be focused inward to the point that you write yourself off as a bad person, as young Conor had done to himself for his own secrets. Each human being has two sides to them and can simultaneously be good and evil. This applies to not just Conor in the film, but also to his grandmother and father. For the former, she is losing her daughter to cancer. She has already lost her husband - with the established fact that Lizzie coped in the exact same way as Conor - and is struggling to find a way to accept that she will lose her daughter too. She takes out her anger in various ways and does boss Conor around, but she loves him and her entirely. His father loves him as well, even if things are not perfect. Yes, he re-married and has a new daughter, but he still loves Lizzie and Conor. It is just that things could not work between them and now his job has him in Los Angeles."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0
silence;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;Jan 14, 2017;"[ ""My mother more than anybody else is the reason I am a Christian today. She raised me a Christian, but never forced my hand. When I was young, she asked whether I wanted to accept Jesus in my heart or not. In high school, she told me she would love me no matter what and did not want to force me to believe in Christ. Above all, she taught me that a relationship with God is a personal endeavor. It is not one to embark on through another person. Instead, reading the Bible, speaking to God, and praying for guidance from Him is the path to fulfillment. You must find God for yourself and it likely not the same way God is viewed by others. As such, I have never gone to Church, nor will I likely ever find myself listening to somebody preach about God. Instead, I pray daily. I try to live up to his values, but I fail every single day. I sin and ask for forgiveness. Ashamedly, I am often like Kichijiro (Y?suke Kubozuka) in this very film. Constantly asking for forgiveness only to commit the same sin once more is a great vice and struggle of my own. To see it portrayed in this film is riveting and heart wrenching. Yet, Silence's pre-eminent impact upon me is two-fold. One, what I have discussed. The personal relationship with God that one must form in order to truly know Him. Two, the doubt that comes with following the path of righteousness. If I have not doubted my faith everyday that I have truly known God, then I must have not been awake long enough on the missed days to grapple with my faith."", ""A harrowing portrayal of God's supposed silence, but solemn stolidness alongside us through our trials and tribulations, Silence is set during the mid-1600s. Depicting the horrifying torture and persecution of Christians in Japan, Silence stars Andrew Garfield and Adam Driver as two priests, Father Rodrigues and Father Garupe, tasked with finding Father Ferreira (Liam Neeson). Allegedly a fallen priest, Father Ferreira had gone missing and fallen victim to the wrath of the inquisitor. Father Rodrigues and Father Garupe have faith, however, that he has not left the faith. Upon arrival in Japan, they find a horrible picture. Torture, pain, and hidden Christians who are persecuted and threatened with death. This leads to some graphic moments, but the film is not overly violent. Instead, it gives a face to the sound of the tormented who were forced to suffer as Christ once did."", ""That said, Father Rodrigues - after suffering for a long time - has an encounter with Father Ferreira. It is once Father Ferreira is brought into the fold that Martin Scorsese's incredibly personal film soars. With Father Ferreira, Father Rodrigues learns why they are being persecuted and why they have failed to lead the Japanese to Christ. Above all, he learns that beliefs speak louder than actions or words. As such, we see Father Ferreira explain that the language and cultural barrier is too great for somebody uninitiated in the culture to teach the Bible. Though those being killed are dying for what they believe is Christ, they are instead dying because Rodrigues (and Ferreira before him) had told them to die. It is only through the apparent and repeated renouncement of God that their suffering will stop and, as such, it is a necessity. However, they learn to live in hiding. By day, they identify Christian items for the inquisitor. Yet, all throughout the day, they speak to God and foster their relationship with Him. Though they renounce Him to the Japanese when they ask, it is done to further the word of God throughout the country. By hiding and denying Him verbally but not in their hearts, it is not an act of self-preservation, but a way of letting Christianity survive in Japan. As Father Rodrigues says at one point, to say that he is dead, it would mean that Christianity in Japan is dead. Without Father Rodrigues and the other fallen priests retaining the faith within them and not causing their people to suffer, they gain strength and are able to do their work as missionaries. Those who seek the fallen priests and wish to learn the way of God are rewarded with a man that is able to speak to them about God. Though the film does not depict these moments, the final shot of Father Rodrigues still holding the cross after he is dead certainly shows that the man died a man of faith and, as his scene with Kichijiro highlighted, he was still willing to shine a light for others."", ""One of the most important moments of Silence, however, is when Father Rodrigues steps on the image of God. In the Bible, God rebukes those who worship idols and practice idolatry. This image is an idol. It is not God. God Himself tells Father Rodrigues this when we hear God speak for the first time in this film. He encourages him to step on the image and to save the suffering followers. Father Rodrigues does so and the Japanese Christians suffering in the pit and tied upside down and spared. For the rest of his life, he finds other idols and reports them to the Japanese."" ]";0;2;0;2;0;0

While we all have lost loved ones, few have lost a spouse. Even fewer have lost that spouse while the First Lady of the United States and none of those women were alive to be there for Jackie. She was isolated and all alone. Nobody could comprehend her grief and nobody, thankfully, can today. Sitting next to her husband driving through a parade, he is shot and his mangled head rests on her lap and she sits there with his blood splashing on her body. In this eternally lasting image, few have sat down to truly examine what that day and the succeeding few days were in the mind of Jackie Kennedy. However, in director Pablo Larrain's intimate look at her mind and grief in those days, he finds beauty, pain, and agony. But, above all, he finds a woman with so much strength, so much grace, and so much power, it is chill inducing. Punctuated by a powerful and articulate performance by Natalie Portman, the film leaves you in emotional ruins repeatedly and is an entirely beautiful, moving, and stirring portrayal of the strongest and hardest week of Jackie Kennedy's life."", ""Upon its release, Jackie gained notoriety for its unique structure. It is not a biopic at all. Shot with grainy documentary style footage, the film is an inside look at both Jackie's life after her husband's death and the descent into madness experienced by the country afterwards. However, that is not what makes it unique. Rather, the film is lyrical and poetic. Its dialogue is overwrought, begging to be quoted. It feels too prim. Too precise. Too detached from reality. Yet, that is entirely the point. This is no biopic about Jackie Kennedy. It is an album composed of \""songs\"" about her life and key defining moments: the death of her husband, the televised tour of the White House, planning for the funeral, and talking to a priest. Complemented by interludes courtesy of an the famed interview with Life Magazine, the film takes on a poetic approach to telling its story and this is incredibly irregular for the genre. As a regular of the poetry of the storytelling, it is nonlinear and it  shows scenes from those aforementioned moments before and after the assassination in varied order."", ""This structure truly lends itself to the way in which the film is quotable, but overwrought. Its dialogue is aching to be recognized as powerful. As timeless. As stirring. Yet, it is all of those things. He may feel a tad forced in this regard, but it works. Matching the hypnotic, dream-like, and thoroughly lyrical nature of the storytelling, the dialogue feels mystical, other worldy, and unattainable. Jackie's words are so well chosen, as are those of her counterparts. In this, the dialogue catches the class, the grace, and the power with which women in her position are expected to act and speak. Her words are well chosen for fear of portraying herself and her husband negatively. In her interview with the journalist (Billy Crudup), she unleashes at times and becomes less formal, but never allows him to print these words. In these moments, she becomes wordier. With those she acts entirely formal around, her words are limited and more carefully selected. While I say the film is overwrought, it is not to detract from the film. Rather, it is perfectly elaborate in its limited words and prim/proper dialogue. Each word and each line feels quotable and verbose."", ""This verbosity is certainly what led the Kennedy's and others in power to seem unattainable. In particular, their life was a fairy tale. It was spectacular, overwhelming, and extravagant. Their wealth was obscene and otherworldly. It embodied regality and the belief that this was the royal family of the United States, if there ever were to be one. Larrain, a Chilean-born filmmaker, has managed to eloquently and brilliantly captures this cult of personality surrounding the Kennedy family and captures it so well, in fact, that the film has been criticized for the same reasons Jackie was criticized in her life. It is too cold. Too distant. Too reserved. Yet, it is for these elements that the film is so brilliant. Not only is it poetic and gorgeously crafted narratively, but its feeling and emotions as a film keep the audience at a distance. It never hopes to understand Jackie and her mindset after her husband's death, as that is an impossible enterprise to undertake. It is simply something that could never be accomplished. As such, instead, Larrain's film reduces intimacy. He uses grainy documentary style footage, old school television footage, and has a cold and carefully orchestrated Portman in the lead role. She embodies Jackie Kennedy to the very last detail both in her manner of speaking, walking, and body language. It is a film that is cold and dead behind the eyes, shutting out the world from every hoping to understand the pain its main character underwent and preventing us from fully grasping who she was."" ]";0;0;0;0;1;0
allied;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;Mar 28, 2017;"[ ""An old school style romantic thriller, Allied feels both modern and cut right out of the 1940s. Gorgeously captured, designed, and staged, Allied is an - at times - lyrical and entirely compelling look at World War II espionage through the eyes of two lovers. Director Robert Zemeckis cannot help but constantly reference Casablanca with his two lovers meeting in a bar in Casablanca, but though the film is deeply indebted to the Golden Age of Hollywood, it is somewhat similar to Steven Soderbergh's The Good German. Another film that I love (sue me), that film attempts to take the style of film noir - going as far as shooting in black-and-white with German expressionist lighting - and tell a story that could have been told in the 1940s. Many found it to be a mess and, admittedly, Tobey Maguire is entirely out of place there. Allied suffered much the same fate as it tried to capture the same appeal of a romance not-really-melodrama-but-sort-of-melodramatic war film akin to the aforementioned Casablanca or another Humphrey Bogart film, To Have and Have Not."", ""That said, Zemeckis does not go the full nine yards like Soderbergh. Instead, he often channels films such as The English Patient or, believe it or not, Children of Men. Both far more recent, the two feel like a clear influence on some of the style of Allied, whereas the story and romance feels ripped out of 1940s cinema. For the former, the comparison is clear: war-set romance tale that partially occurs in the desert. It is clear from the trailer alone that Zemeckis had seen Anthony Minghella's stunning beauty of a film, with its style of desert shots clearly bearing influence as Zemeckis sets up stunning shots of the desert as one of the highlights of the film's cinematography. However, a sex scene in a car in the desert between Max Vatan (Brad Pitt) and Marianne Beausejour (Marion Cotillard) appears to also channel Minghella's film with the couple engaging in an extended sex scene as a sandstorm blows all around them. A similar scene also occurs in The English Patient, though without the sex. Instead, Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas simply chat and grow closer due to their small confines. One could argue that the raw passion between the two spies is their own way of sharing war stories like those shared by Fiennes."", ""Yet, Allied's action scenes seem akin to Children of Men. Perhaps not a direct influence, I admit, but a stylistic one nonetheless. Upon viewing Children of Men years ago, I was immediately struck by its action scenes as Clive Owen and company try to shoot their way out of various destroyed buildings. Of every film I have seen, this film still stands as the one that best simulated the action scenes of a video game. It put you in intimate contact with the action and made it feel as though you were doing it yourself. It is is a hard style to describe and it is not due to the POV. Instead, it simply feels like a video game. Allied's action scenes have the same feeling with Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard shooting their way out of the ambassador's ball with bodies flying. The shooting and reactions of the men who are shot feels like a cut scene from a first person shooter as the story progresses before you regain control of the main character. However, the film also feels akin to Alfonso Cuaron's 2006 film in its camera work. Though not a continuous shot or anything, the camera in Allied feels free flowing. It floats around the characters and the locale, hiding behind storefronts or rushing ahead of the characters and awaiting their arrival in the frame or just waiting on the curb after they drove off in the distance. Capturing the beautiful production and costume design, the camera in Allied feels like an entity in and of itself with it trying ambitious shots that were unlikely to be seen in 1940s cinema."", ""Story-wise, the film shows the romance between Max and Marianne and, as the trailer shows, throws a wrench in their marriage with Marianne being accused of being a German spy. Deliberate, tense, and unpredictable, the film ditches the happy ending demanded by 1940s audiences and instead sees it to its logical conclusion: a torn relationship as a result of this accusation. No matter whether it is true or not, what was between them has been snuffed out due to suspicion and uncertainty. Brilliantly portrayed by Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard, the two entirely sell both the rise and fall of the relationship. Captured in small subtleties, such as Pitt's Max lurking over Marianne in his uniform as he must go to work on his day off, the slow demise of the relationship due to her possible work as a spy is haunting and heart wrenching. From the excitement of a day off (the beginning) to the slow and sad realization that the one you love must leave (the fall), Allied captures the gorgeous nuances of this relationship in great detail. Though occurring during WWII and various bombings, the center of this film is always its two lovers."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0
fences;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;May 29, 2017;"[ ""Denzel Washington's Fences is undoubtedly a flawed work. With its screenplay written by the play's writer August Wilson, Fences is a film that is entirely connected to the stage. With dialogue heavy scene after dialogue heavy scene for two hours, Fences can be an exasperating film to watch with how much of it is relying upon nothing but words. For two plus hours, this is undeniably a major challenge and one that can prove too much at times. However, it is in those words that the beauty of Fences reveals itself. Brilliantly written with aching roots in reality, Fences is certainly a tremendously acted film, but the star here is August Wilson's writing. It is vibrant. It is raw. It is emotional. It is, above all else, real. The film's writing is what gives it fire in the first place and the what brings it triumphantly over the finish line. No matter where the film may slack, creak, or trip, the script is always there to pick it up and point it in the right direction."", ""While Wilson's eloquent use of language to have the characters express their emotion without having to come out and have the characters say exactly what they feel serving as terrific footing for the film, it is his ability to develop those characters that will stand the test of time. As a challenge for this, Wilson sets the film in 1950s Pittsburgh in the inner city and in the home of a garbage collector named Troy (Denzel Washington). With a wife named Rose (Viola Davis) and a son with her named Cory (Jovan Adepo), a son with another woman named Lyons (Russell Hornsby), a brother dealing with mental illness named Gabe (Mykelti Williamson), and a friend named Bono (Stephen Henderson), Troy's life is one of fear. At every turn, this big behemoth of a man is afraid. Projecting confidence and aggression to mask this fear, Troy compartmentalizes his fear into baseball references and elaborate stories of how he fights off death. Yet, underneath the surface, he is a man who knows he has already struck out and is nearing death. As he pushes away his son Cory and derails his dream of playing football, Troy also antagonizes Lyons, signs away Gabe to the state, and cheats on Rose. He is a man who is failing and struggling to stay afloat and to keep a roof over his family's heads, all while bearing the weight of that burden. He is a man who is so afraid that he will fail and be rejected by his family that he winds up crushing himself under the weight of it all and pushes away some of his family in the process. Of all the people in the world, Rose is the one who sees this. As Cory leaves and even Bono leaves, Rose stands by her philandering husband and even raises the daughter he has with another woman. Why? Because she sees him for what he truly is on the inside. No matter how abrasive he is and how aggressive of a person he can be, Troy is just scared and latching onto anything he can in order to not fall or to forget that he is falling. The thought of death, though he approaches it with great machismo, is something that scares him. He refuses to admit he did not go pro in baseball because of his age, instead blaming it on the whites. Why? Because that would require admitting he is old. When Cory challenges him, he only fights back when Cory calls him old. He is a man afraid of growing old and dying. Rose, for the the pain he has caused her, refuses to give upon this man. Instead, she opts to stand by him and hold his hand as he slowly and loudly slips out of this world. Though it would be easier to leave him to rot in the bed that he had made for himself, she loves that man that has become consumed by fear and refuses to let herself become consumed by that very same fear. Instead, she fights back and declares war on it in order to provide her husband with the strength he needs to fight back as well."", ""One of the greatest challenges undertaken by Fences is to make Troy likable. For the part of Rose, Viola Davis' brilliant and raw performance combines with Wilson's eloquent writing to make her the one we root for. When Cory takes on his father to defend his mother, we want him to kick his ass. Every time Troy lets down Rose, we want her to leave him and for Rose to kick his butt. Yet, she never does. This could make Rose seem to be quite the confounding character if Troy remains this detestable person that we cannot root for. On the surface, he is an angry, self-hating, narcissistic, and cruel man. He treats his sons like garbage and his wife even worse. His words are hollow and leave you longing for a better man to step into his place. So, how does Wilson make Troy a man you can root for, even with Denzel going full \""You know what I'm talkin' 'bout **** Partially, it is because of Rose, but the rest is because of how he writes Troy. In his boasting and reminiscing, you can hear that tinge of emotion. Denzel does an excellent job bringing it to life, but the writing gives it the beating heart to open those lungs."" ]";0;1;0;1;0;0

Both show a main character grow up and undergo otherwise mundane experiences, but those experiences are things that leave an indelible mark on him for the rest of his life. Moonlight, however, is different in scope. It is a journey of self-discovery undertaken by a man who is decidedly \""other\"". He is black and living in the inner city with a drug addict mother and a drug dealing man who looks after him a bit. He is - as he will discover - gay. This is tough as a whole, but especially in the hypermasculine environment in which he lives. For Chiron, life is a minefield and one he must navigate or simply be consumed by it, all while figuring out who he is and what he wants."", ""Barry Jenkins' film gracefully slides through Miami with Chiron and his life, while properly giving weight to each significant moment in his life. Jenkins let's the camera linger, while Chiron - never much of a talker - rarely ever says anything. This allows the moment to really land on the audience, which makes Moonlight a film that is entirely heartbreaking. From a bullied youngster who first experiences being called a **** to a teen who has his first gay experience while finally fighting back against the bullies to an adult who has become everything he once stood against, Moonlight is an enriching and tragic film."", ""However, Moonlight is equally a look at the black experience in America, particularly in the inner city. Chiron's father is gone. His mother, Paula (Naomie Harris), is a drug addict. The only people who show him any love are Juan (Mahershala Ali) and his girlfriend Teresa (Janelle Monae). However, Juan is a drug dealer and sells to Chiron's mother. Clearly, his life is far from neat. When introducing his sexuality, his relationship with Kevin is all the more complicated by both's need to display masculinity on the outside, which leads to them physically hurting one another often. There is a connection between them - highlighted by the brilliant acting of both's final version, Trevante Rhodes as Chiron and Andre Holland as Kevin - but it is not one that can be explored due to the barriers between them. The look Kevin gives Chiron reveals all you need to know about how they feel about one another. Yet, it is hardly an option for either due to the need to look tough."", ""In all areas, Jenkins' script is phenomenal. Truly nuanced character development, which allows all characters to show growth and a variety of dimensions and faces they show to the world. However, one of the greatest accomplishments is Juan. Mahershala Ali is being mentioned for an Oscar nomination and he certainly deserves one, but the writing is equally good. A sensitive, yet hard nosed drug dealer, Juan helps out Chiron whenever his mom kicks him out. He defends him and opens his home to him, while acting as a father figure for this lost child. Yet, he is a drug dealer. In reality, Juan is a foreshadowing of what Chiron will become. This is incredibly tragic and certainly something Chiron is aware of by the end. He knows his life is not built to last due to dealing drugs, but he is there because he never knew who he was and could never figure it out, because of his own thoughts on how a black man from the inner city should act. Juan reveals a lot of this, merely through his interactions with a young Chiron, especially his solemn regret when Chiron calls him out for selling drugs to Chiron's mother. The similarities between the two (the doo-rag, the poor relationship with their mother, drug dealing, etc.) are numerous and often quite subtle. However, it reveals their connection and why they were drawn to one another."", ""Moonlight is also beautifully shot, essentially relying upon the light of the moon to give sequences at night this sort of magical glow. Each scene at night is obviously quite dark, but the faces of the actors are glistened with this sort of hazy glow that really defines the look of this film. And what a look it is. Moonlight is a beautifully shot film with tremendous lighting and this beauty equally matches the beauty of its journey."", ""A tale of self-discovery and losing yourself to your environment, Moonlight is a moving and tragic film that will stick in your mind for weeks to come. All of the acting is tremendous and to pick a standout performance would be far too difficult. Every actor brought an authentic quality to their role, which is fantastic to see given the tremendously written characters."" ]";5;13;5;8;0;0

Somehow the directorial debut of Kelly Fremon Craig, the film is polished, smart, witty, and a poignant look at the depressed/ostracized teenager of today. While now a trendy topic, The Edge of Seventeen still remains an important film due to its approach to growing up in the digital age. While an incredibly funny film, it still manages to pull back the curtain on depression and shows what low self-esteem can do to a person who is already on the outskirts of the social world. In a powerhouse performance, Hailee Steinfeld grabs the film by the reins and steers it home, furthering cementing her status as a rising star in the acting world. At her side, Woody Harrelson turns in his best performance in years."", ""The Edge of Seventeen focuses on 17-year old Nadine (Steinfeld). Different from the other kids, she has always had trouble making friends. However, her best friend - Krista (Haley Lu Richardson) - has been with her since second grade. Since that time, Nadine's father - her at-home best friend - died. Now, she is stuck with depression, a brother who is popular, and a mother who has never gotten on well with her. All of this is the formula for Nadine's breakdown when Krista begins to date Nadine's brother, Darian (Blake Jenner). Everything Nadine is not, she feels deeply hurt that her best friend has betrayed her and, in Nadine's eyes, grown past her."", ""A poignant film, The Edge of Seventeen has many cliches from the wise teacher to the meet-cute with a guy in Nadine's class, as well as her fumbling through a potential sexual encounter with her dream guy. That said, it still brings enough originality through Nadine. Incredibly well-written and fleshed out, Nadine's struggles are universal with some tremendous dialogue along the way that really highlights her inner-feelings. Particularly, at the end when she describes how she likes to imagine she is the only one with problems to, potentially, feel unique. A moving scene, this moment really underscores what is Nadine's problem and why she struggles to fit in. Her own worst enemy, she projects negative intentions on others due to her own low self-esteem. She assumes people cannot like her or love her because of her own insecurities. A throwaway line, yet one of the best, comes from Krista. When Nadine is nearing getting over Krista dating Darian, Krista says, \""I missed her.\"" Though Nadine may not love herself, others do. Krista does. Darian does. Mona (Kyra Sedgwick), her mother, does. Hell, Mr. Bruner (Harrelson), her history teacher, does. If only she can stop hating herself, her eyes would be opened to how much she is loved. That said, it is easier said than done."", ""Insightful into the struggle of a teenage girl to find the ability to love herself, The Edge of Seventeen is often moving, largely due to its authenticity. Each character acts like a real human being and speaks as though they were one as well. The situations are universal, especially for those who were unpopular in high school. In  this way, it manages to be incredibly impactful with Craig able to create a film that is truly poignant without being sentimental or schmaltzy. It hits home because it is real, not because it is manipulative."", ""While the drama element is tremendously written, so is the comedy. Largely coming from Woody Harrelson or Hayden Szeto (who plays Erwin Kim - a boy who likes Nadine). The dry humor and deadpan delivery of Harrelson's Mr. Bruner is a lot of this films charm. Every scene Harrelson is in, he steals it completely. Similarly, the love-struck and awkward Erwin is brought to life through tremendously awkward and nerdy delivery by Szeto. Every encounter between him and Nadine is imbued with the curiosity, awkwardness, and uncertainty of all potential teenage romances, which - again - makes it incredibly impactful. While witty and incredibly funny, The Edge of Seventeen strikes an excellent balance between the comedy and the drama that few films can ever dream of accomplishing. Jokes do not obstruct here. They add and come at terrific times with great delivery by all."", ""Poignant and funny, The Edge of Seventeen is a tremendous debut from Kelly Fremon Craig. Many have compared her to a modern day John Hughes and maybe this is true, but I need to see more before making the comparison. As it stands, this is a terrific debut with great direction, phenomenal acting, and writing that is smart, witty, and respectful of its characters, even when their struggles are somewhat self-created.

hacksaw-ridge;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;Feb 25, 2017;"[ ""Mel Gibson, along with Martin Scorsese, has a finger on the pulse of Christianity. In The Passion of the Christ, Gibson's much maligned film, he brilliantly captures Jesus and his essence. Though many hate the film, it is a personal favorite of mine. Powerful and brilliantly capturing Jesus through the eyes, rather than words, Gibson's film is one that struck at my very core. Hacksaw Ridge did the exact same thing, but rather than showing Jesus himself, he shows how the words of Jesus and actions of those who follow Him can transform lives. Transcending human definitions of courage, the powerful true story of Desmond Doss - a conscientious objector who saved 75 lives on Hacksaw Ridge as a medic - is a brilliantly told and entirely powerful film. For those who are not religious, the film may come home as hokey and corny, which are fair criticisms. But, as a Christian, I ate it up with a spoon and went back for seconds."", ""Perhaps the biggest flaw of Hacksaw Ridge is how it wears its influences on its sleeve. In particular, Full Metal Jacket. With the first half being set in basic training with a hard-nosed and funny drill instructor, Sergeant Howell (Vince Vaughn), and the second half coming full force with violence, explosions, and shooting, the film lacks the thematic ruminations of Full Metal Jacket while embracing their visceral impact. It is hardly original in this set-up and it is unfortunate that Gibson just ripped off that film - it transcends influence - and gave it his religious twist. The film's first half is also further maligned by cliches with the introduction of Doss's wife, Dorothy (Teresa Palmer). Sweet and romantic, the romance always feel incredibly nostalgic and innocent, but never really feeds into his character development too much. The picture in the Bible or the picture as a \""Oh wait, I almost forgot\"" gift from a girlfriend to her boyfriend heading off to war is a tried and true cliche that is about reaching the end of its run too, right? The cliches of the first half and then the Full Metal Jacket structure render the first half largely being the weaker one by far."", ""Fortunately, the second half is impeccable. Bloody and brutal, the film's violence can be a bit numbing, but is beautifully captured. Expert staging and choreography plus brilliant cinematography with an emphasis on the greens and browns of battle and bombs, contrasted by the deep blood red of violence, the film is absolutely terrific. It may be a bit comically over-the-top, but Gibson painstakingly captures both the strategy and the violence of war, infusing it all with great tension and thrills. While many cite the second half as being far weaker (as they do with Full Metal Jacket), it is brilliant in my opinion. Yet, one of its greatest complaints is how it contrasts with the first half and the pacifism on display there. Personally, I see no issue. Desmond wanted to go to war and this is war. He knew there would be blood, so the audience and the film understand there must be blood. It is a war film and though Doss's tale is vastly different than many other soldiers, it still must show the brutal reality of war and Gibson does so brilliantly."", ""Yet, the film finds its greatest power in the last half hour. As Doss races back and saves 75 different men, painfully lowering them down the ridge after his own men had long gone aside from two guards, the film turns into Church. Begging God to let him save one more and asking God what his purpose is in this battle, the film is moving, powerful, and entirely resonant. Though a bit preachy, Gibson's film shows the struggle for Christians in violent situations or the world as a whole. With chaos all around, how do we live up to Jesus' example? Where are we needed and what is our purpose in this world? Doss is confronted with these questions in the heat of the moment and must act quickly, performing what he believes to be God's purpose for him in war. With his bravery and courage quietly performed, Doss is a man that serves as pure inspiration for anybody searching for this purpose in this world as an agent of God or anybody seeking to be brave in an unconventional fashion."", ""A striking tale of bravery with a tinge of pacifism and an anti-war message, Hacksaw Ridge is a powerful, riveting, and truly gorgeous film. Just as with The Passion of the Christ, it play more resoundingly with Christian audiences, but it is a great war film in its own right. It may be too cliched and influenced by other war films at points, but Gibson knows violence and uses that knowledge to craft brilliantly smart battle sequences that resonate nearly as much as its appeals to its Christian target audience. Hokey and corny, Hacksaw Ridge is the cinematic version of Church and plays strongly at fears of Christian persecution. Yet, in spite of that, it is undeniably powerful and a terrific film for audiences willing to go along with its spiritual core."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

An erotic thriller that shows mastery of suspense akin to Alfred Hitchcock, but with a blending of eroticism akin to Brian De Palma, Paul Verhoeven, or Adrian Lyne, The Handmaiden is a brutally violent and erotic film. Blending eroticism with extreme violence like that found in films such as Basic Instinct, The Handmaiden is a lovingly crafted film that is equal parts horrifying and titillating throughout its run time. Though it suffers from Park Chan-wook's films always feeling too distant and disconnected (personal opinion), The Handmaiden's stark beauty is impossible to deny and this is what lifts it above his other films for me. That said, the plot's suspense and thrills are secondary to the visual beauty of this film, which is striking."", ""Changing the novel's location from Victorian England to Korea under Japanese rule, Park Chan-wook's film still feels Victorian. With the regality and the building design often reflecting the castles and mansions one could find in Victorian England, The Handmaiden still shows that influence. Yet, of course, these buildings are entirely Japanese/Korean. The interior design reflects this in the home of Uncle Kouzuki (Cho Jin-woong), as it is entirely Japanese and feels like something one could find in a film by Akira Kurosawa. Lavish, regal, and alive in its own rights, these buildings are intricate, detailed, and absolutely lovely. The interior and the exterior are gorgeous with the camera finding just the right ways to capture this beauty. Often shooting from behind the trees, the home is usually somewhat obscured in the darkness, instilling an ominous feeling about this place. The trees add to the distance communicated by the entire film, as Park Chan-wook never fully let's you in and keeps you an arm's length away from the proceedings. This is captured in the cinematography, but even then, the visuals are strikingly gorgeous."", ""This production design is further felt by the aforementioned cinematography that takes full advantage of the beauty on display. Every shot is gorgeous and lovingly crafted. Not a single frame of this film feels out of place and really flows together and is entirely engrossing. This is a dark, disturbing film, but the visuals communicate an odd beauty and romance to this violence and disturbing level of sexuality. Of course, it is benefited by the framing and staging. Every moment is precise, definitive, and decisive. Not a foot is put wrong in this film where each actor communicating their character brilliantly and breathing life into the film with every step they take. It is the movement of the characters that makes this a full-fledged visual masterpiece as it manages to add yet another layer to visual approach of this film. Beyond the production design, staging, and cinematography, the costume design is also brilliant with each design representing the lavish and royal lifestyle of its characters. The design's are intricate, well put together, and lovely to look at throughout the film."", ""Though an erotic psychological thriller with a penchant for violence and disturbing moments, The Handmaiden is also darkly comedic. For instance, one such comedy scene finds Sook-hee (Kim Tae-ri) holding up Lady Hideko (Kim Min-hee) to prevent her from hanging herself. Upon learning distressing news, she runs off to cry only to quickly realize she has left her Ladyship strangling herself from the branch. Additionally, the multiple depictions of tentacles and the octopus in the basement are hysterical tongue-in-cheek additions by Park. And of course, the scene where Hideko has intercourse - supposedly - with a knife. Really off-the-wall, uncensored, and truly outrageous moments that add some darkly comic twists to a film that is dark, dark, dark."", ""Sexually, The Handmaiden is very much like a Verhoeven film. Though more pristine and less gritty, the scenes are shot to titillate. Park Chan-wook exploits his seemingly lesbian characters for the enjoyment of male viewers with classic lesbian sex scenes occurring that, regardless of their practicality, exist solely to entertain the male audience. This is very much like what people like De Palma or Verhoeven would include in their film, though it would be shot differently. Park Chan-wook's stages these sex scenes almost symmetrically at times and very rigidly. The scenes are tense, sensual, and almost regal is how they appear and look. It feels more like a Todd Haynes sex scene from Carol in this regard, as it feels pristine. Now, of course, Haynes' lesbian sex moment is far more withdrawn and focused on the passion and love. It is intimate, not exploitative. The Handmaiden exploits its characters' sexuality for the purposes of male entertainment, which is a shame."" ]";1;1;1;0;0;0

In my ever-so-humble opinion, all of the film's problems are reduced to ash when compared to the everlasting, remarkable beauty of the film. For me, it is easily one of the most beautifully shot films of all-time. Without question. Where it ranks amongst films in terms of cinematography is debatable, but this film is not just eye candy. It is an eye buffet."", """", ""The film's plot has to be its weakest element alongside its pacing. A little slow and a little too manipulative at times, The Light Between Oceans keeps shoving melodrama at you and expects you to cry. When it fails, it shoves another handful in your face and shows discontent when you do not begin to bawl. That said, it does manage to get you a few times, especially with the love between Tom (Michael Fassbender) and Isabel (Alicia Vikander), as well as in scenes between Isabel and Lucy, These scenes really tug on the heartstrings and are effective at their goal. In particular, the final letter from Tom to Isabel, as well as the one from Isabel to Lucy really knock you on the ground in fits of crying. This is largely in part to the strong characterization of the major players, as well as the sensual chemistry between Fassbender and Vikander. They just worked together very well and the film benefits tremendously from their irresistible chemistry."", """", ""However, as hinted to before, the film takes a little too long to get into things. It lays the groundwork very well, but some better pacing could have helped out this issue. It just felt like the final 3/4's were dedicated to the actual drama of the film. Before that, the first act just kept chugging along and developing the love between Tom and Isabel. While it is a very well developed love story - not so much romance, but certainly love - it is simply unbalanced. It needs more the drama and less of the melo."", """", ""Now, pushing those issues aside, the cinematography made me want to run around the theater shouting, \""F*** YES\"". I had to scrape my jaw off the ground multiple times with the beauty of the cinematography and I am not just talking about the beautiful aerial shots of the water. Whether it was cliffs, a shot in the distance from the lighthouse, a shot of the sunset, or shots of the waves crashing ashore, those shots are easily identified as being beautiful. These shots do not set it apart. Instead, what sets it apart are scenes such as the one in which Lucy goes missing. While the scene may be a little filler in the film to a degree, there is no way it could be cut because of the shot of the search party with flashlights in the dark. Brilliantly framed and truly arresting, the cinematography of that scene in particular was so perfect it caused me physical pain. As an overall, the film often takes the feeling of an old-time picture with a goldish hue giving the film the appropriate period look and almost a dose of nostalgia for the 1920s. This goldish hue is truly gorgeous and really blends perfectly with the aforementioned shots of the ocean. Together, all of these wind up producing a truly arresting and visually immaculate film. If this one does not get serious nominations for Best Cinematography, the film gods should blind all voters because they are not using their eyes for their intended purpose."", """", ""As a whole, The Light Between Oceans is flawed. A hit-and-miss tearjerker, it is certainly overlong and a little manipulative. That said, I really could care less. The cinematography is not just a 10/10. It is a 500/10. It is that good. Not since I watched Days of Heaven or The New World by Terence Malick have I been this awe struck by the cinematography of a film. There are times when I obviously find it beautiful, but nothing like this. The Light Between Oceans, from grand sweeping shots over the ocean to shots in the town to the slight gold filter on the film, is truly a sight to behold."" ]";0;2;0;2;0;0
hell-or-high-water;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;Aug 25, 2016;"[ ""Texas fried to its very core, Hell or High Water is a film with a deep Southern fried aesthetic from its look, feel, and killer soundtrack/score. With terrific performances from Chris Pine, Ben Foster, and Jeff Bridges, Hell or High Water is a thoroughly unique family-fueled crime film. It may be a touch heavy-handed at times with its anti-bank mentality, but this is more than overcome by its terrifically crafted characters. The brothers are very multi-dimensional, as though they may be criminals, we feel for them deeply because of their circumstances and hope they can get away with it all. That said, even the cops are well developed. Bridges' character and his relationship with Gil Birmingam's character is terrific. Not only is their banter hysterical, but for friends and fellow cops, they are given a shocking amount of depth. In addition to its terrific writing, Hell or High Water is a sturdy film that defies expectations, as is tradition with David Mackenzie's films. He takes typical premises and more than just spruces them up. Instead, he reinvents it and turns it into a fully nuanced and powerful film that explores family relationships and how far you will go to help your family. Even more, it explores the violent nature of man and how thin the line between life and death is and can be. The film's cinematography is also terrific with some seriously beautiful shots strewn through this film. Not only did it capture the Southern aesthetic as previously mentioned, it really captured the look and feel of the towns it was set in. This is also heavily due to the film's terrific production and set design. Overall, Hell or High Water is a real gem set to go down as one of the very best releases of 2016."" ]";1;2;1;1;0;0

Starring Ewan McGregor as Perry, a professor who is unexpectedly approached with vital information on the Russian Mafia by gangster Dima (Stellan Skarsgard), the film is a slow building film, but one with a stellar pay-off."", ""As with all of the adaptations of Le Carre's novels, Our Kind of Traitor is incredibly precise. Its actions are slow and drawn out. This allows White to inject the film with incredible tension and, occasionally, a unique visual style. Throughout the film, much of the film has this very sleek, glowing look that establishes Our Kind of Traitor as both a good looking film and a decidedly modern one. At times, however, it can be extremely distracting. For example, there is one scene in which McGregor is sitting and is overtaken by a bright orange lens flare that obscures our view of him. I can only hope that was unintentional."", ""Yet, even when that occurs, the film is incredibly well-written. Tense, deliberate, and with a ton of moving parts, Our Kind of Traitor is a Le Carre spy adaptation, through and through. It is very subtle and a lot happens that the film simply expects  the audience to keep up with it. Fortunately, if you are paying attention, this is hardly a challenge and it is very rewarding to watch a film that trusts its audience to keep up and does not feel the need to spell everything out."", ""The acting in Our Kind of Traitor is also tremendous. McGregor is terrific in the lead role, as the unsuspecting and personally maligned college professor who gets thrown into international politics. Skarsgard, as the repentant and family-focused member of the Russian mafia, is boisterous and loud when needed, but equally solemn and subtle when things turn serious. The balance he strikes between these two personalities is quite compelling to watch and never a let down. As the stolid MI6 agent, Damian Lewis is pretty stereotypical, but brought a cold, calculating edge to the role that really made his performance incredibly captivating."", ""In a world of action spy films dominated by James Bond and Ethan Hunt, John Le Carre spy films are a breath of fresh air every time. Even if Our Kind of Traitor is not the best film of the recent bunch, it is still a terrific spy film that is thrilling, engaging, and smart. Even better, it respects its audience and trusts us to follow along with the complicated web it weaves. Our Kind of Traitor is simply my kind of film."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

This game asks new sign-ups to either be a watcher or a player. Watchers, well, watch. Players are tasked with dares they must complete for serious cash prizes (one such dare rewards $15,000!) depending on the challenge of the dare. Often dangerous, death-defying, illegal, or simply incredibly awkward, the dares increase in difficulty along the way, putting our characters in serious harm. A comment on the culture of anonymity on the internet, Nerve is a fast-paced, fun, and certainly important film that reaches the target demographic incredibly effectively."", ""With all of today's top 100 pop songs as its playlist, as well as incredible usage of technology such as facetime/skype, Facebook, computers, and texting, Nerve is a film aimed at teenagers. However, it is adorned with an authenticity that makes it feel real. It is a film for millennials by millennials. As such, a lot of teenage lingo is included and will likely leave older viewers feeling old. Yet, this hyper, knowledge at your fingertips culture does have a truly positive impact on the film, as it is a very quickly paced movie. Things accelerate quickly and the film races alongside its characters with odd amounts of ease, as it never loses itself or becomes too quick. Instead, its hyper speed really matches the modern society incredibly well, allowing the film to be a great parallel of the 21st century and put it in prime position to critique our world."", ""And critique it certainly does. Highlighting the risks behind internet anonymity, internet game trends, cyber bullying, and peer pressure, Nerve is certainly a film of the moment. In particular, the climax of the film really highlights all of these dangers and shows the lengths our society has been driven to, as a result of being able to hide behind a screen. Though the ending may be in your face, it certainly has to be, given its target. As us millennials are likely staring at our phones, Nerve knows it needs to spell out its message and it certainly does this. However, this force feeding does not undermine the grace or execution of this message. Rather, it only furthers its urgency. In many ways, the climax parallels something out of Ancient Rome or lines Maximus would and did scream out at the crowd in Ridley Scott's Gladiator. Should our society not stop hiding behind a screen, which allows us to commit atrocities, there is certainly a chance we end up like Rome and Nerve recognizes this threat. If the person on the other side of the computer stops being seen as a human by the user, our society is doomed and Nerve is an urgent call to wake up before it is too late."", ""This said, Nerve is hardly all message. Rather, it is still an energetic film without its message and could be categorized as a teen romance to some. The definition of teenage romance with 25-year old Emma Roberts starring as Vee who meets another \""player\"", 31-year old Dave Franco who plays the risky daredevil Ian/Sam. In all seriousness, both Roberts and Franco turn in very good performances with terrific chemistry. Though relying upon teenage movie cliches, the duo are really well fleshed out and their characters' chemistry is very good. While some may say that Vee certainly turned on a dime from the beginning to the risk-taker she was at the end, it does feel plausible to me, given Ian/Sam's personality. A risk-taker who Vee was immediately captivated by, she essentially felt the need to play catch-up and fed off of his energy, rather than making a change in her own personality. Rather than changing, she was merely emulating the actions of the man she fell for. That said, these characters are hardly perfect. With useless back stories and supporting characters that are really not that well fleshed out beyond cliches (the friend-zoned hacker guy friend, the slutty best friend, and the Asian friend)."", ""Yet, Nerve makes up what it loses in characters with #aesthetic. One may claim there is too much neon in this movie. In fact, it overwhelms one shot towards the beginning. Though it often mirrors reality, Nerve it felt the need to make it almost dream-like or Nicolas Winding Refn movie-esque with every light swapped out for the neon equivalent. With glowing blues, pinks, and yellows, Nerve is one neon-filled film. And I loved it. There is no such thing as too much neon. The one could be one huge lens flare of neon that obscured the entire plot and I would have been completely satisfied. There may be a day where a film comes out with too much neon, but Nerve is not that film. Rather, it creates an oddly surreal looking world that just looks absolutely terrific. Set against the dark gray buildings of New York City, the color palette here really pops."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

Sandberg does it with ease in this scare-filled, chilling, and atmospheric horror film. Never knowing where the attack will come from next, Sandberg's horror instincts are top-notch, but what is even better is the story. Far too often, horror movies ditch the story in favor of just trying to scare its audience. However, Lights Out develops its characters, it story, and really earns it scares and horror. At the end of the day, it is as divisive as all other horror movies, but it has an undeniably great concept and, for me, it executed this concept perfectly."", ""Starring Diana as our resident evil being, this poor family has been stalked and hunted by Diana for a long, long time. Though impeccably scary, her back story and her connection to this family are incredibly well-developed and compelling. Sandberg, in this case, turns the film almost into an investigative drama as Rebecca (Teresa Palmer), her little brother Martin (Gabriel Bateman), and her boyfriend Bret (Alexander DiPersia), piece together who Diana is and her relation to Rebecca and Martin's mom, Sophie (Maria Bello). In this section, Sandberg manages to create tension through the mystery of the entire proceeding and invites the audience to solve the mystery along with the characters, which is always a fun enterprise to undertake as an audience member."", ""However, the real point here is to scare you. Though cliched in parts, the film's unique concept allows the film to take a unique approach to these cliches and always keeps you guessing throughout the runtime. Along with the characters, we are forced to guess where Diana is and, as her movement is hard to pinpoint, you can never really guess where she is hiding. Sandberg definitely has a lot of fun getting his character's and audience's mind racing with this element and uses it in order to buck cliches."", ""In terms of its characters, all of them are largely well developed. However, all are bolstered by their actor. Particularly, Palmer is terrific as Rebecca and really steals the show. Along the same lines, Bello perfectly portrays the tormented Sophie who cannot escape the clutches of Diana, no matter how hard she tries. Though you can see the ending coming, its power is bolstered by the acting of this duo who allow the film to reach a terrific emotional and horror crescendo."", ""For a horror film, Lights Out is terrific. For a debut, it is all the more impressive.

arrival;9;Spangle;/user/Spangle;Nov 11, 2016;"[ ""It is official. Denis Villeneuve is my favorite working director. This could change, but my Lord is Arrival brilliant. Incendies, Prisoners, Enemy, Sicario, and now Arrival are all some of the best films of this decade - no, century - and each has an indelible respect for the audience. It trusts that we will follow along as Villeneuve spins a web that, though it may not make sense initially, will craft a gorgeous vignette of some element of existence. Arrival is most certainly a part of this collection now and is one of the best science fiction films in a while with stunning visuals, chill-inducing brilliance, and incredible performances."", ""Admittedly, however, Arrival missed the mark for the first half or so. It seemed so different. So unique. Nothing truly made sense from the opening with this daughter that seems out of place for the film I expected to receive, plus the weird narration scene by Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner). It just seemed so haphazardly put together that it seemed wholly indigestible. However, after this halfway point, the film is pure brilliance. Even better, it opens up the world of the first half to the point that you realize that - even if the narration is still a moment that I cannot wrap my head around -  everything else adds up. In this second half, Arrival soars with the grace and beauty previously only experienced by eagles."", ""A confusing, nonlinear film, Arrival follows Louise Banks (Amy Adams), the country's best linguist in the aftermath of the arrival of extraterrestrials. In the interest of determining their purpose, Louise is tasked with cracking the code of the heptapods (the aliens). What transpires is film that can often mirror Dances with Wolves in its respect for language (Close Encounters of the Third Kind as well to a degree for this) and Contact for its similarities regarding the military and its approach to, again, language. In many respects, Arrival is a science fiction film, but it is also a film about destiny, free-will, and the beauty of language."", ""Through language, worlds open up. One can weave a beautiful sentence that can move readers to tears. Others can craft a speech that sways people to believe one thing or the other. Language allows people to express feelings, emotions, thoughts, or simply converse with others. Language, as discussed in the film, is the foundation of a civilization. In many ways, it is the foundation of humanity. Arrival delves into this sheer beauty of language throughout the picture. Villeneuve brilliantly allows this elegance to take centerstage with long drawn out sequences of nothing but communication between Louise and the heptapods."", ""Yet, the film hardly stops there. Through showing the possibilities the language of the heptapods can reveal, Arrival hits a peak. Once we learn that the heptapods language allows the speaker to see the future, Arrival's philosophical explorations really take hold. This is the part where many will be lost and why I am skeptical as to film's acceptance amongst general audiences. However, the film's nonlinear storytelling is incredibly revealing and really works. Through the nonlinear storytelling, we know the end of Louise's story. We do not know that we know this, but by the end, it is clear what her future is. Louise knows it and though she keeps it to herself in the present, we know the future is something that is simulatenously her past. It is already a part of her and one she cannot escape. However, it is clear she does not wish to escape her future. It is one filled with challenges, but filled with equal joy and love. Films have previously discussed the concepts of free-will and destiny (hell, Oedipus did this in the BC's) and yet, Arrival brings a warmth to the discussion. Though Louise may know her future, she chooses to head into it with no hesitation. Yes, it will bring her unspeakable pain and tragedy, but it will also bring sheer ecstasy. For Louise and many others, this is more than acceptable. However, Arrival does not hesitate to ask: If you know your future, would you try to change it? This is certainly a fallacy, as I believe Arrival showcases. The heptapods knew Louise's future. How? Because it already happened. There is no time, there is no free-will, there is only destiny. For the world of Arrival, the possibilities of the world are not endless. You are on a path and destined to complete this path."", ""Arrival often mirrors the language it discusses, not just the heptapods' language, though. Language, as Louise states frequently, can be messy and confusing. Yet, it opens doors to the world that were previously locked tight. This is very similar to the film as a whole, as it is a complex puzzle and my initial hesitation to the film's world was because I only received small pieces of a large puzzle. Once they started fitting together and the image became clearer, the film became a truly awe-inspiring, striking, and beautiful experience."" ]";3;16;3;13;1;0

Things really begin to hit the fan in the second half, but even then, the first half is just as equally brilliant. Together, they form a disturbing look at the fashion industry. Undeniably a horror film, The Neon Demon leaves you cool and numb in the wake of its disturbing images of the industry. Refn expertly creates a parallel between the industry and what is portrayed on the screen, eliciting brilliant criticism on the industry and the way in which it destroys young girls, as well as the way in which these girls are victimized and corrupted along the way. Elle Fanning plays the lead role brilliantly, as the innocent, yet decidedly dangerously beautiful Jesse. The dialogue here is terrific, far surpassing many other films from the Danish director. The score from Cliff Martinez is filled with these synthy, creepy vibes that really wrap its tentacles around you and perfectly accent what is on the screen. The cinematography is incredible. From very cool mirror shots to lush looks at Los Angeles, the camera soaks in the neon goodness and is an absolute wonder. I cannot praise The Neon Demon enough.

Well paced and well-crafted, The Nice Guys has incredibly multi-dimensional characters and the film as a whole really pays homage to a bygone era, especially in Los Angeles. I am an absolute sucker for these neo-noir films set in Los Angeles, especially ones with fantastic cinematography and The Nice Guys most certainly fits the bill. Undoubtedly set to go down as one of the funniest films of 2016, The Nice Guys is not just some brain dead comedy.

His second feature, and most notable until now, Blue Ruin was a tremendously brutal and suspenseful thriller. Green Room is pretty much the same deal, just shrouded in green and far more of a contained thriller than his previous effort. Starring Anton Yelchin, Imogen Potts, and Patrick Stewart, Green Room is a thriller about a punk band that witnesses a brutal murder while after performing for a group of neo-nazis. Now, they must escape while every neo-nazi in sight tries to keep them trapped."", ""In one of his final films released before his death (if not the final), Anton Yelchin is magnetic as Pat, the bassist of the band. As Amber, a girl who witnesses the murder, Imogen Potts is equally terrific. However, both pale in comparison to the performance of Patrick Stewart as Darcy, the leader of the neo-nazis. Ruthless, brutal, and quite sadistic, his Darcy is a fear-inducing character written with real menace by Saulnier. Stewart's performance is so captivating, he instills the viewer with fear even when he is off-screen."", ""In terms of his direction, Saulnier's Green Room is incredibly tight and focused. The film introduces very little in the way of subplots and even when it does, it reduces them to ash immediately. It is incredibly focused on the survival element at play here and every effort is poured into that area. In this area, Saulnier creates tension at every turn. Though the film is quite short, Saulnier is not afraid to take his time to create atmosphere and elicit tension through repeated sequences of uncertainty and attempted escapes. Unlike many thrillers/horror films, Green Room has no cheap thrills. Instead, they are well-earned."", ""Green Room is an incredibly violent picture with an unabashed love for boxcutters that has been unseen since 2014's Gone Girl. Ideally, Rosamund Pike and Imogen Potts are ushering in a new trend: blonde women with boxcutters. Just as in Blue Ruin, Saulnier is not afraid to get graphic, but he uses this violence well. It is not just violence for the sake of itself. Rather, it is violence that leaves the viewer in shock, regardless of whether it was expected or not."", ""However, one area in which the film can be improved is character development. Though incredibly tense, the film does very little to develop any of its characters, which kind of deprives the emotional impact of each individual's death to a degree. Plus, there are so many players in this film, it can be hard to keep track, especially when it comes to the neo-nazis. Additionally, though the film introduces neo-nazi characters, Saulnier never really uses it for any political symbolism. Sure, the punk band sings an anti-nazi song and makes a few comments about them, but it is hardly a major focus. While the film is an incredible thriller, it could have a more nuanced film with some kind of subtle statement about neo-nazis in modern day America, but that is just personal preference, I guess, so not really a criticism or a reason as to why this one is rated as it is."", ""As a whole, Green Room is a terrifically entertaining and intense thriller that is not shy about showing the audience casually brutal violence. Saulnier is one heck of a talent and his next work will be yet another must watch."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

Helen Mirren, Alan Rickman, Aaron Paul, and Barkhad Abdi, turn in very good performances here in this contemplative war thriller. Incredibly uncompromising, Eye in the Sky's dedication to showing you the unseen human element of warfare and the emotional turmoil it can cause is exemplary and commendable. Far too often, war films will avoid this exploration of human emotion and pain, instead focusing on action sequences. This is not the case at all with Eye in the Sky as it consistently considers the human aspect here and not just for the people behind the drones, but also the people on the ground who live near drone targets. In this way, Eye in the Sky has to be one of the better war films of recent memory. While not the best one of all-time, Eye in the Sky certainly ranks up there with the most emotionally damaging and haunting experiences I have had watching a war film. For this, Eye in the Sky truly is a winner. Incredibly dramatic, thrilling, and moving, it is a powerhouse of a film that feels like a punch to the gut."" ]";2;2;2;0;0;0

Though it is slow and deliberate, the film never drags and really always grips you as you watch it all unfold.

The ending sequence also features terrific special effects and give the film a feeling along the lines of Spielberg's 70s and 80s science fiction classics due to the sense of wonder it inspires. The sense of mystery is highlighted by the film's synth-like score that really threatens to steal the show at times. Its low notes put you right on the edge and add this air of mystery that leaves you guessing until the very end. The lighting and cinematography are also top-notch, especially with the film largely taking place at night. It is always hard to shoot at night, but Midnight Special makes it look easy and, even better, the lighting lets you see everything, yet keep enough shrouded in darkness to make it both visually pleasing and mysterious. This film has a lot going on, is quite slow, and does not have a pay-off many will appreciate. However, I certainly did appreciate these elements. The slow pacing never arose as an issue because enough is going on to really keep you hooked and zoned in on what is going on in the film. Additionally, the ending is perfect simply because the proceeding 1 hour and 40 minutes were so mysterious. A mysterious ending is the only way to end this one as the characters never showed any level of understanding as to what was happening to the boy. Thus, it only makes sense that they remain in the dark along with us and get looked at as if they are crazy.

Touching on all the key movements of the 1950s from the classic films to the politics therein, the film really skewers the time period and entertains along the way. Lavishly crafted with fantastic production and costume design, the film both looks and sounds the part. Channing Tatum honestly stole the show for me comedically, as all of his parts were hysterical. George Clooney, Josh Brolin, and Alden Ehrenhich, were the real stars here and knocked it out of the park. Ralph Fiennes, Tilda Swinton, and Frances McDormand, were also very good in smaller roles. Overall, Hail, Caesar is an absolute riot if you love film and film history. It appears many moviegoers thought it would be more of a serious kidnapping type movie, but if you know anything about the Coen Brothers, you know there is always more than meets the eye in their films and their classic kidnapping trademark.

Phoenix is a film that rips your heart out as you watch this woman realize what has happened in the aftermath of her being sent to a concentration camp.

Instead of explicitly telling you how they feel, it leaves it open for you to pick up on their intentions. Above all of other elements, this is what makes the film feel so authentic. They act and speak like real human beings who express their feelings, but not directly. These women leave bread crumbs for the viewer to figure out what really makes them tick. Not only does this indicate incredible trust given to the audience by Haynes, but it also highlights his trust in the writing and the actors to convey meaning."", """", ""Visually, the film is equally as stunning. Cinematographer Edward Lachman's camera is a magnet for beautiful shots. The heavy reliance upon reflections and mirrors is what truly caught my attention the most, especially when considering when they are utilized and the overall meaning of the film. Carol, above all, is a film about being true to one's self. Carol could have stayed with Harge and kept her daughter. Therese could have married Richard. Yet, neither felt truly satisfied in that life when without one another. Lachman captures this in his use of reflections. In one particular sequence, Therese goes with Carol to visit her home, with Richard bidding Therese goodbye before she leaves. As they drive, reflections abound. Symbolically, this most closely represents the double life being led by these women. A mirror merely reflects who you are, but is not you true self. It is other. This reflection is Therese's life with Richard. The camera then juxtaposes these shots with her in the car with Carol, highlighting how that is her true self. She is meant to be with Carol and it is her path to happiness."", """", ""Lachman and Haynes also use a notable color scheme for the entire film, with many shots being covered with an apparent green filter. These shots are accented by the heavy use of brown, red, and yellow. Interestingly, when Carol first visits with Therese, she is wearing red. However, after her daughter is taken from her and the two women see each other once more, it is Therese wearing red. As red often represents passion, one must assume that this is foreshadowing. Initially, Carol was the one pursuing this relationship. Therese knew she was infatuated with her, but was not confident enough to pursue her. Carol, meanwhile, had experience in the area and did pursue her. However, once her daughter leaves, she is more concerned with being reunited with her daughter, not being with Therese. The opposite is true for Therese, who has blossomed and is filled with passion and wonderous feelings for Carol."", """", ""Finally, the cherry on top of the film is score. Carter Burwell's score hits all the right notes and truly highlights the setting and feelings of the film. This is a very cozy and warm film. The colors certainly highlight this as well, as does the setting"" ]";2;2;2;0;1;0

The entire film goes from emotion, romance, comedy, and tragedy, in a very natural manner that makes this one really hit you hard. As a period piece, it was inevitable I would like this one. Beautiful costume and production design, as well as some fantastic music really set the mood for this one. The direction is very good as well, though certainly not the strongest element of the film.

Watching the financial collapse happen almost all over again is a gut wrenching experience that The Big Short turned into the best time I had in the theater all year. Honestly, The Big Short may be the most entertaining and informative films I have watched in a film. Unique in its storytelling, entirely subversive, and odd/quirky, The Big Short is a great time and does a great job explaining its, at times, complex story. At no point do you feel lost or confused by its complex terminology, because it always bring it to the point where you can understand exactly what is happening. Even more, it is hysterically funny at times. Truly, it skewers its villains and twirls the knife with glee, though it does certainly leave its protagonists seeming more than a little morally and ethically ambiguous. Ryan Gosling and Steve Carell are absolutely phenomenal here. Christian Bale and Brad Pitt are also very, very good in their roles. Director Adam McKay manages to exceed all expectations with his directorial ability here and, honestly, I am not sure who else could have pulled it off with such a complex and unique way of telling this tale. The Big Short is not the best film of the year, but is certainly a contender for funnest film of the year."" ]";1;2;1;1;0;0

I say that as someone who does not really like Lee, so this one ranks as one of the few I do like. A provocative look at the situation in Chicago, the film makes you want to run out and change the world like portrayed in the film. The writing is phenomenal and incredibly creative and shows the great blending of the Greek comedy and the hip-hop influence to be found in the film. Nick Cannon, Teyonah Parris, Angela Bassett, and John Cusack, are all phenomenal here. Admittedly, the film can be a bit vulgar and far-fetched at times, but if you are willing to go where the film wants you to, it will be a very enjoyable experience. Though the plot itself can be messy, it is thematically tight and the pieces all work if you think about what they are symbolic of and are meant to represent, a lot of which ties to both the Greek-influence, as well as today's violence and sexuality. Chi-raq will not be for everyone, but was luckily for me."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

With very good comedic writing, Ghostbusters is funny from beginning to end and truly never lets up. Heck, I was laughing even during the credits and the post credits scene. The film is funny, through and through. The girls have great chemistry with one another and Kate McKinnon particularly is fantastic. Leslie Jones is no slouch, however, and is fantastic. I had low expectations for her since she is hit-and-miss for me, but she was phenomenally funny. All four have great timing, though they all kind of get overshadowed by Chris Hemsworth. His turn as the dumb bimbo of an assistant is terrific. Every word he says is hysterical and never failed to make me laugh. I was rolling in my chair with how funny some of it was. This film is a true joy to experience and is thoroughly funny. On top of this, the special effects were great. The ghost design was scary and light, while also looking quite cool. The gags with ghosts were also solid and very funny (especially during the final battle sequence). Additionally, I saw it in 3D and the 3D was fantastic. I rarely love 3D and think it makes a difference, but it absolutely was the case here. The 3D was great and, on one occasion, made me jump so bad. In short, I loved this. It was a great experience and it is sad that people were predetermined to hate it because it \""is ruining their childhood\"" or is \""anti-man, Paul Feig hates men and I hate feminism ahhh\"". Idiots. There are legitimate problems with the film, but few negative reviews actually rely on these and instead rely on perceived insults to men, none of which is the case. The villain is poorly done and the plot is certainly not fantastic, but neither really matter to me, because it is a comedy. It is supposed to be fun and boy oh boy is it ever fun.

Sicario manages to cover the drug war and cartels as violently and as bleak as it should without being too violent or too bleak. Though, it still paints an incredibly grim picture of the situation and nobody winds up looking good in this situation. I should also mention that Roger Deakins is the best living cinematographer. His work on this film is magnificent. One of the best shots films I have honestly ever seen, this one follows up one beautifully shot scene with another beautifully shot scene and uses every technique in the book to the very peak of its potential. Emily Blunt is phenomenal here, but is actually outdone by Benicio del Toro. I love Del Toro's work, but this has to be his very best.

I should also mention that the costume design matches this style brilliantly with some seriously great suits and dresses. Not a fashion connoisseur by any means, but man did both the guys and women in this film look sharp. As a whole, The Man From U.N.C.L.E. never takes itself too seriously and is very funny, while also having very thrilling action sequences throughout that are incredibly well shot and well directed. For me, I preferred this to the other recent spy film, Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation, though both are very different as that one aims to be serious, while this film takes a far more comedic approach.

An honest look at both high school, friendships, and death, Me & Earl & the Dying Girl is funny from beginning to end and guaranteed to make you fight back tears (a fight you will more than likely lose). The film is also a film nerds wet dream with so many references and mentions of classic films that the film itself is as much as an homage to classic films as the amateur films made by the characters. Though there are better coming of age dramedies out there, Me & Earl & the Dying Girl is certainly one of the better ones I have seen thanks to great acting, directing, writing, and a heartfelt story that feels so relatable it almost hurts.

Each line of dialogue is crucially important and revealing about the character who says it, but it is left to you to decipher what it could possibly mean. The film is also really well shot and much of the tension comes from the framing of these shots and the mystery surrounding the proceedings. Jason Bateman and Joel Edgerton are phenomenal in this one and Rebecca Hall also turns in a very strong performance.

Stewart was my personal favorite, though the against type performance from Moretz was really interesting and well done. The story is very dense, but can be boiled down to being about an aging woman having a relationship with a younger woman, after having the shoe be on the other foot when she was younger. Now that she is older, she struggles to grapple with this age and the shoe being on the other foot, due to her own approach to the relationship when she was younger. In this way, the film is a compelling look at aging, both on stage and in life, and at relationships of all kinds. Finally, the cinematography is fantastic. The film has repeated gratuitous shots of landscapes in the Swiss alps and thank God for that because is pure eye candy. The cinematography in non-landscape scenes is also great though and that point cannot be understated.

Impossible to follow and impossible to wrap your head around, Inherent Vice is a film that gives you a bunch of different puzzle pieces from different puzzles and tells you to put them together. Yet, in spite of that, I loved it. Our confusion mirrors that of Doc and really makes the film and enjoyable watch. It also does not hurt that it has a stellar cast on top of Joaquin Phoenix, including Benecio del Toro, Josh Brolin, Reese Witherspoon, Katherine Waterston, Joanna Newsom, Michael K.

That is what makes this film so special, as it breaks down those walls and allows everyone from every different clique to really see the others as they truly are: people just like them. However, what I really liked about the film is one of the discussions they have at the end, where they discuss how their friendships will be once detention ends. This discussion really rings true as I think everybody knows that these kids will never see one another afterwards and, if they do, they may ignore them or mock them after seeing them because of high school social pressures. While this one is a very accurate representation of high school and all of its oddities, it is also very funny. At many times, I found myself laughing quite hard at something somebody said or did.

This passion is contagious as the film truly puts you in the shoes of Dr. King and his fight across the nation, particularly in Selma. Smartly focusing on one event in Dr. King's career and the Civil Rights Movement as a whole, Selma is able to properly broach the topic and give it the weight it deserves, rather than skimming through it as part of a larger biopic.

For the aforementioned sound effects, they are truly what cause the scares. Much like in Alfred Hitchcock's classic film Psycho, the sound elicits a major reaction out of the viewer and really sets the tone for the scenes in which that sound is used. Brilliant. Honestly, this one of the most well-executed uses of metaphor of symbolism I have seen in a while, The Babadook is a brilliant film wrongly placed in the \""horror\"" genre. Truly terrifying, The Babadook is more than just a horror film. It is a meditation on life and dealing with loss. It also made me screech like a high school girl being asked to prom by her crush in the way it used that symbolism and hit a home run with it (ahhhh flower symbolism ahhhh). While some scenes are classic horror in the way they elicit a response, the true terror is to be found underneath the skin and the way in which it hits home and brings a feeling to true terrifying life. Ultimately, I recognize this type of film is not for everyone, but The Babadook is a film that let's everyone know how grief feels and brings that feeling to life because ultimately, \""If it's a word or it's a look, you can't get rid of The Babadook\"".

Instead, many would let the film got bogged down within itself and make no sense in the end. For Byrkit, however, things remain oddly linear. Who we are watching is unbeknownst to us, yet everything is the same and the viewer is able to follow the plot without nary a hitch. As Byrkit adds more and more layers to this film, things remain within our grasp and the film never feels like it is too much. It never feels silly.

Hilarious, touching, and fantastically musical, the film is a wonderfully entertaining take on the fairy tales of old and their worlds, while adding in a nice twist with the trademark moral of the story. First off, the music is fantastic. Both the musical sequences and score are beautiful and sung perfectly. The acting from Anna Kendrick, Emily Blunt, and Meryl Streep, is very good. Additionally, the direction from Rob Marshall is very good. Without it, this film would have been DOA due to the mashup of various stories. The pacing is good, though it can be a touch frenetic in the beginning, but it was far from detrimental. The script is good and really does a good job balancing everything. The cinematography and special effects are great and capture some seriously beautiful shots together. Into the Woods can also be truly hysterical as it gleefully makes fun of musicals and the fairy tales it incorporates. However, the piece I loved the most was the ruminations on life (and the dangers hidden within), love, loss, grieving, and parenthood. This is where the film is a home run success and truly becomes a major success. Into the Woods can be weird at times and it requires a willingness from the audience to go along with it, but on the whole, it is a funny and truly emotionally moving musical that has fantastic music to go along with it."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

Additionally, the costume and production design are very good, as is the sequence of Hawking's decline. Each stage is appropriately handled and given its due weight. Though I do not care for the man, he is undeniably brilliant and this shines through in the film and you feel a sort of sense of awe watching his mind work.

whiplash;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;Mar 17, 2015;"[ ""Damn is this one intense. Throughout, this one makes you feel as though you are the one being screamed at and belittled. Wow. Stellar direction from Damien Chazelle, insane to think that this is his directorial debut. The sky is the limit for this wonderful talent. The writing is strong and wherever it stalls or the story stalls, the direction is strong enough to make up for it. Though, what really makes this film is the acting. Miles  Teller and JK Simmons are MARVELOUS. I really wish the studio was able to campaign for both of them, because Teller deserved recognition for this role as well, though I am glad that Simmons rightfully received numerous accolades. Teller has a bright future ahead of him if this and The Spectacular Now are any indication, as he was brilliant. I never expected a film about orchestra to be as harrowing and intense as this, but man oh man does Whiplash ever keep you on the edge of your seat. The interactions between Teller and Simmons rival that of Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins in The Silence of the Lambs, that is how intense and well done they are, as that is my favorite film of all-time."", """", ""What prevents me from giving this one a higher rating, however, is that you can tell this was a short film stretched out to feature length. While stuff added certainly adds to the overall film, the odd romantic element served little-to-no purpose and any development could have been achieved elsewhere. In addition, even his relationship with his father felt like filler to add to the run time. This film is about a kid who plays drums who wants to be great and his overly intense teacher. If the film had stayed a bit more focused in that regard, I would have given it a higher rating. As it stands though, Whiplash is a terrific film that displays the talents of both Miles Teller and JK Simmons, while also establishing Damien Chazelle as a director to keep an eye on."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

At really no point does it lag and while it is certainly very slow at times, it never becomes boring and leaves you hanging on the edge of your seat for much of it. Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike are stellar here, as are Neil Patrick Harris and (oddly) Tyler Perry. The cast, on paper, seemed odd, but in practice, David Fincher shows why he is one of the best around and got the best out of everybody. The general feel and mood of the film is also brilliant and entirely chilling. However, beyond the whole murder mystery type deal, the most interesting part to me here was the total indictment of the media and the 24 hour news cycle, which Fincher does a great job showcasing throughout and how the media will believe just about anything and then jump to conclusions based off of what small information they may have. The twists and turns here are also very interesting and the script from Gillian Flynn is very strong. The way the story was told at times was odd, but that would be my only complaint really and it was nothing major. As a whole, this is certanly not Fincher's best work (Seven, Fight Club, and Zodiac, would be my top three from him), but it is certainly not his worst (excluding Alien 3) and is overall, a very well made, well acted thriller that will leave you wanting more.

Truly, this film feels important and brilliant. However, what does hold this one back is it feels distant.

Together, Tom Hiddleston and Tilda Swinton are phenomenal and have deliciously odd chemistry with one another. Director Jim Jarmusch does a typically great job at handling this odd vampire film that is very nicely paced and incredibly well crafted. Honestly, however, my favorite piece here is the look and style. Incredibly stylish, Only Lovers Left Alive has phenomenal cinematography (especially the lighting) is absolutely phenomenal.

Brilliantly directed, executed, and paced, Blue Ruin is a definite success. Macon Blair shines in the lead role and truly commands the screen and does a great job portraying this broken character. Saulnier never fails to amp up the tension here either, as you are constantly on the edge of your seat here as the violence and unfolds. In addition, in just an hour and a half, the film does a great job developing all characters and plot elements to where it feels as though you truly have a grasp on everything that is happening in the film. As a whole, I went into this one expecting a good film and, luckily, that is exactly what I got in return. It is always a nice thing when a film lives up to expectations. The only negative I would mention here is the violence can be gratuitous at times and really took me out of the film in those moments.

Tom Hardy does brilliantly to capture this element and really turns in a powerhouse of a performance. The direction from Steven Knight is fantastic, as is the writing which perfectly captures Locke as a person, as well as everyone he talks to on the phone. Though Locke is the only one we ever see, the people on the other end are so well crafted that seeing is not believing here. You get their full emotion and passion through just the phone calls, which is truly impressive. The cinematography here is gorgeous and really does well to capture the claustrophobic setting and feeling of the film, while also just being simply gorgeous at the same time. Overall, Locke is a phenomenal piece of film that showcases both Hardy's acting skill and Knight's skill as a storyteller. This film is something else."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

Smart and impeccably well crafted, this installment's first half is a little weak at times, but the second half is unmatched in recent times from war films. Honestly, this and its first installment have to be some of the best war films of this decade and up there for this century as a whole. Director Matt Reeves picks up where Rupert Wyatt left off with a beautifully poetic and stunningly crafted film about Caesar and the apes. Mirroring foreign politics on the brink of war in real life, all of those same problems and confusions are represented here with a deeply human and moving film the result. Neither side is good, neither side is bad. Instead, it is one big shade of gray with plenty of confusion on both sides. The cinematography and score are once more incredible. The special effects are fantastic and the fight choreography incredibly impressive. Many modern day blockbusters lack weight and an air of importance and \""epicness\"".

I loved the lighting at night and, on top of that, the shots during the day are also very beautiful. It truly is eye candy. It also functions great as a psychological thriller as, even though it slow going in the beginning, when it kicks into high gear, you are left wondering \""Wtf wtf wtf wtf\"" as events unfold.

As a result, the nuns at her church took her child away and sold him, along with many others, to adoptive parents. Now on a quest to find her son with journalist Martin Sixsmith (Steve Coogan), Philomena is a truly affirmative, moving, and well-constructed true story."", """", ""Often times true stories can slack a bit in terms of pace and interest, simply because you can see the way in which the director is constrained and forced to stay to the story. Philomena certainly does not showcase any of this. Instead, director Stephen Frears ably handles this true story that is interesting in its own right, but he does a great job wringing the drama and emotion out of this. As a result, Philomena is not just a film that tells a story of a mother looking for her son. Instead, it is a universal tale of journey and discovery for both Philomena and Sixsmith and a film that has a heart. There is a heart and soul to this film as it passionately tells this tale of injustice."", """", ""With truly brilliant performances from Judi Dench and Steve Coogan, Philomena further convinces me that I need to see more of Steve Coogan. I have only seen him sporadically, but that is clearly not enough. Together, they have terrific chemistry and they work together to find Philomena's son and find out what happened to him after 50 years. Dench plays Philomena with incredible class and majesty, as is to be expected for a woman with such dignity and prowess. The scene in which Philomena forgives Sister Hildegard for all of her sins against Philomena is incredibly powerful. The way in which she can forgive someone who wronged her so much is something that we all could learn from. Dench plays the scene to perfection with incredible emotion, yet with equal strength."", """", ""The film does a great job not just making me fight back tears, but also dramatically. As the duo try to uncover the mystery, the film is packed to the brim with drama, furthered by the hurdles they must overcome in order to discover the truth. Though cliched in spots in this regard, Frears does a good job executing the cliches and still manages to make it damn near thrilling as they sort through the evidence and find her son. Above all, however, the film is truly emotional, particularly the ending and when Martin discovers the truth about Philomena's son. Frears does a terrific job capturing these moments, while his two leads do a great job capturing the power of those moments and their significance."", """", ""Though it may be written off as Oscar bait by some, Philomena is a terrifically well-executed film that is emotional, powerful, and truly dramatic.

saving-mr-banks;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;Apr 23, 2017;"[ ""Sentimental and sugary sweet to the very last drop, director John Lee Hancock's Saving Mr. Banks may not reinvent the wheel, but is pure crowd pleasing entertainment that hits on all the right notes. It will make you cry. It will make you laugh. It will make you feel. Yes, there are visible manipulative strings being pulled by a sinister mouse standing in the background and P.L. Travers undoubtedly turns over in her grave every time somebody watches the film, but dammit, it is very pleasant cinema. While Hancock may pull a bit too tightly on the audience's heart strings to the point that it causes physical pain. Yet, his touches are so sweet and nice, it is hard not to just give into the simple pleasure of the film. I know that films of this type are hated to the point that they get wildly popular 1/2 star reviews on the internet where the reviewer just trashes Disney and lists adjectives as to how the movie is bad, but I really could not care. Saving Mr. Banks is a nice little film may not be a masterpiece, but delivers everything a movie should: joy, laughter, and tears."", ""Telling the story of how Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) convinced P.L. Travers (Emma Thompson) to give Disney the rights to Mary Poppins, the film undoubtedly takes various liberties with the true story in the name of entertainment, but that is neither her nor there. Throughout the process, Travers is quite hesitant. She openly hates every idea Disney and his colleagues offer up, rejects the idea of a musical, and bans red from being in the film. She is eccentric, frightfully British, and incredibly manic. Focusing mostly on Travers and showing her life in Australia with her parents, especially her beloved but alcoholic father Travers Goff (Colin Farrell), it quickly becomes clear why she is hesitant to give up Mary Poppins: the story is her life. To give it up is to move on from that point of her life and to finally let go of her father and forgive herself after all of these years."", ""The scenes of the making of Mary Poppins are classic \""movie about movies\"" material and, as always, this plays out quite well in my eyes. I am a sucker for movies about movies and this one is absolutely not an exception. The process of getting the rights to the novel and creating every bit of a movie I have never even seen is positively riveting to me and Saving Mr. Banks aces it throughout. The film's more manipulative parts, its flashbacks with Colin Farrell lushly riding off into the sunset on a white horse, still do play well. They may be a bit cloying and drastically overly sentimental, but it provides great development for Travers and shows why she is behaving the way she is with the creators of the Mary Poppins movie. It provides context for the inspiration for each character and why she holds onto them so dearly. The scenes may be a bit too much, a real trait of Hancock's, but their nostalgia and depiction of trauma and how one reacts to it is rather beautiful. Each tear is well-earned and though sentimental and sweet, the scenes work due to the installation of a sense of wonder and imagination that really brings the old school movie magic the film tries to create."", ""Emma Thompson, as P.L. Travers, shows why she is a cinematic treasure. Brilliantly displaying her regret and hesitation at signing Mary Poppins away due to what she represents to her, Thompson equally plays her controlling and intensely witty nature. Much of the film's comedy comes from the mouth of Thompson with zippy and smart lines rolling off of her tongue with ease. Playing off of Hanks' steely, bubbly, and determined Walt Disney, Thompson's seemingly oblivious and demanding Travers who seeks to push Disney away from her beloved property through innocuous demands and pushing them too far, really works well. Together, they occasionally make you laugh, but mostly deliver the drama of the film. Again, this drama is a bit sentimental and dripping in nostalgia, but comes out on top because of the excellent chemistry between Thompson and Hanks in these moments."", ""Unlikely to convince haters of John Lee Hancock's brand of sentimental cinema, but hardly worthy of the vitriol some online reviewers throw at it, Saving Mr. Banks is a touching tale of a woman trying to save her work. While she eventually gives in and is willing to share her creation with the world, she must first forgive herself and end her grieving over her beloved father. Funny, charming, pleasant, and melancholy, Saving Mr. Banks plays the audience's emotions like a violin and while it may play a bit rough, the film's overwhelming pleasant nature wins out in the end and makes this one an absolute joy to watch."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

the-counselor;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;Dec 21, 2016;"[ ""The Counselor is a verbose, overstuffed, yet disastrously terrific work from Ridley Scott. Densely written by Cormac McCarthy, The Counselor shows that McCarthy was not willing to compromise his style in translating it to the screen. With SAT words aplenty, McCarthy's script is alien with characters forced to say lines that no human being in these situations would ever dream of actually speaking. However, in doing so, McCarthy sets up The Counselor to be a film that is not some crime drama, but instead a poetic and mythical film that hardly bears any resemblance to reality. That said, this language - as it is in his novels - is beautiful to hear. Though it is this language that undeniably contributes to the film's divisiveness, it is also its problems with apparent filler and its incoherent narrative. What is not for debate, however, is the brilliance of the acting. They take this messy material and turn it into a chaotically beautiful work that, though flawed, will likely become a favorite of cinephiles for years to come for the very flaws that it has."", ""The Counselor's message is clear and brought forth by Cameron Diaz at the very end. Those who are cowards will be eaten by the predators in this world. In the world created by Ridley Scott and Cormac McCarthy, the predators are the cartel. Brutal and unrelenting, they kill with an odd sort of beauty that turns murder and maiming into a sort of art. It is with this in mind that the film approaches its subjects. Led by the Counselor (Michael Fassbender), a smart and capable lawyer distracted by greed to become richer, he is undoubtedly a coward. He may pretend to be ready to help run drugs into the country with the help of Reiner (Javier Bardem) and Westray (Brad Pitt), but he is not. He is more content with living and loving his fiancee Laura (Penelope Cruz). However, he enters the game anyways and quickly gets bitten by his cowardice. Afraid and unaware of his situation, the Counselor is effectively a jackrabbit that does not know a cheetah is creeping up behind it ever so slowly. Instead, he is forced to live in agony as he waits for what is around the corner. By the time he figures out death is approaching him, it has become an inevitability. Fassbender plays this deer in the headlights type of role incredibly well, as always, but his terrific performance is certainly matched by Bardem. Extravagant and certainly an odd guy, Bardem plays the role perfectly for the character."", ""The film is stolen, however, by the performance of Cameron Diaz. A career-best performance, her cold and calculating Malkina is the predator. The lover of Reiner, who owns two cheetahs, Malkina herself has a cheetah spotting tattoo that runs down the length of her body. Intensely sexual, Malkina herself links sensuality with the beauty of a predator stalking its prey and she herself defines this characteristic. Her sexual behavior is animalistic and unhinged, designed to scare the cowardice out of her mates. When stalking her prey, she is efficient and smart. While the cartels loom, Malkina is unafraid and hell-bent on securing her own desires. In this role, Diaz is oddly intimidating. She plays the role of the sexed up villain incredibly well with an ability to make any situation uncomfortable for those around her."", ""Yet, the film is flawed. With scenes one could chalk up as filler, such as those with John Leguizamo and Dean Norris, as well as one where Cameron Diaz goes to church, The Counselor is certainly not tight. It is often unfocused and diverting. A slow-burn, The Counselor pays off those willing to wait for it to find itself, but for those unwilling, The Counselor will be a major turn off. However, there is beauty in these flaws. Where the film bloats, it allows for characters to become more developed. Where the film is slow and meandering, it is an excuse for McCarthy to pen gorgeous dialogue as only he can and is an excuse to spend more time in this world. Here, the film truly becomes a diamond, which is a major element of the film. As told to the Counselor (Fassbender's character) by a Dutch diamond dealer (Bruno Ganz), the more flawed diamonds have a far higher value due to those flaws and imperfections. This is the case for the film itself as its flaws make oddly make it more beautiful than it could be if it were perfect. What certainly does not hurt this beauty either is the cinematography. Capitalizing on the beautiful people, set designs, and the spacious desert, The Counselor is an absolutely beautiful film to look at all times and is visually engrossing in this regard."", ""A slow burn thriller, The Counselor is a convoluted and confusing film, but at its very core, it is simply a film about hunters closing in on its prey. What makes it a very good film, however, is McCarthy's script. Here, McCarthy finds poetry in the chaos on screen and brings out the beauty and artistry of the hunt. As with the hunt, the film is intensely beautiful and sexual, with McCarthy"" ]";0;1;0;1;0;0

Featuring stellar performances from Brie Larson, John Gallagher, Kaitlyn Dever, Keith Stanfield, and the entire cast, Short Term 12 is an emotionally powerful film about a group home for teenagers with extremely troubled pasts.

The writing here is splendid and the way the story is presented by Soderbergh is a major strength for this one. The cinematography is also strong here, as is usually the case in Soderbergh's films. The film does take many twists, some of them easier to figure out than others, but ultimately,it manages to keep things really interesting as this one could easily be categorized as many things; medical thriller, psychological thriller, crime drama, and a little bit of courtroom drama, all of which keep things lively and interesting.

An interesting film that touches on thoughts of reincarnation, our purpose in life, karma, and the importance of our actions, Cloud Atlas is wildly ambitious.

Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Jim Broadbent, Hugo Weaving, Jim Sturgess, Doona Bae, Ben Whishaw, Susan Sarandon, and Hugh Grant, in particular are all fantastic.

At the end of the day, this one has themes like every other film, but for the most part, the question, \""What is this one about?\"" can be answered by saying that it is a character study of a deeply troubled man and his father-son type relationship with a cult leader. Nothing profound or deep and, to me, many people are looking into this one too closely and looking for something that is simply not there. Now, onto the film itself. Joaquin Phoenix and Philip Seymour Hoffman are fantastic and are a great juxtaposition to one another, as Phoenix is over the top, unhinged, violent, and angry, while Hoffman is calm, cool, collected, and calculating. Amy Adams is also good here, though I do wish her role was larger, but at the end of the day, this one is about Phoenix and Hoffman's relationship. The script here is also very strong and does a fantastic job developing the characters. The cinematography is gorgeous, in particular the repeated shots of the water and then the shots of them in desert. Really well done and beautiful to look at without question. Paul Thomas Anderson's direction is also strong as well. After watching Punch-Drunk Love and not liking it after having loved There Will Be Blood and liking Hard Eight, I was still worried that maybe Anderson's films would be more hit and miss for me. However, this one convinced me that that may not be the case, as his direction and this film were really good.

margaret;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;Jan  7, 2017;"[ ""At three hours, the extended cut of this film is a really behemoth. I am watching director Kenneth Lonergan's filmography is reverse order, having already seen Manchester by the Sea before watching Margaret. That said, this film further shows that there is a rule when watching a Longeran. If things can get worse, they absolutely will. In this film, a woman is killed by a bus and young Lisa Cohen (Anna Paquin) is a witness and a cause of the accident, as she purposely distracted the bus driver. The rest of the film depicts her trying to right this wrong and come to terms with the negative impact she had in this case. Largely a character study, Margaret is a film with a dire and pessimistic depiction of the world and of human beings. Yet, as is the case with his follow-up to this film, Margaret is oddly emotionally cathartic. Though it really goes the full 12 rounds with your heart and emotions, the film is an operatic and beautiful portrayal of life, death, teenagers, and human relationships."", ""The star of this film is Lisa Cohen. A teenage high school student, Lisa is a complicated character. Young, naive, angsty, antagonistic, strident, dramatic, and in a rush to grow up even if she knows nothing, Lisa is not somebody many people should like. However, why this film soars as a character study is Lonergan's refusal to judge her. At the end of the day, all of this anger, mistreatment of her mother, and distance, comes from her regret and pain over causing the death of a woman. She finds ways to deal with the pain and try to forget about it, though it is causing her great strain in her life and her relationships. She needs to release it all and let herself off the hook. By the end of the film, no matter how bratty and irresponsible and disrespectful she acts, you cannot help but feel great sympathy for her and what she has been through. It is tough growing up, let alone seeing such a gruesome death at a young age. Even more challenging, she is idealistic and believes the world must operate in a certain fashion. Though adults grow out of this, as said in the film, teenagers still have this clear view of the world. When things do not align in this fashion and people do not trip over themselves to agree with her, she is confused, affronted, and distraught. Though her traits make her sound horrible, Margaret truly portrays a tragic picture of Lisa and the shattering of her innocent and naive world. Ignorance is truly bliss and for her, she will no longer be ignorant."", ""An incredibly powerful film, it is clear that Lonergan loves the opera as much as Damien Chazelle loves jazz. With characters going to the opera multiple times in the film, the clearest definition of Lonergan's love of opera is the end. Cathartic, the opera leaves young Lisa in tears next to her mother, Joan (J. Smith-Cameron). The close shows Lisa embrace Joan in tears. While showing the power of the opera, it also shows tremendous growth for Lisa. Fighting with her mother throughout the film, she is now willing to accept her with open arms. She has grown up and is moving past her angsty and existential teenager phase."", ""At times, however, the film also parallels Lisa's interpretation of the opera. Perceiving it to be merely a medium in which the singers try to yell as loud as possible, Lisa's life is very much the same. Fighting with her mom, fighting with strangers, fighting with classmates, and more, she is antagonistic and looking for somebody to unleash upon at all turns. It is as if she is in her own opera and trying to outscream those around her, out of a belief that she knows best in spite of her lack of life experience. This behavior reveals a lot about her character throughout as her response to conflict is to become defensive and argumentative. She shuts out others and just assumes she is correct without altering her view. Yet, it makes sense because her mother is the same way. She overreacts and takes disagreement as a personal attack. She overreacts and pushes people away just because of a disagreement."", ""Powerful, depressing, and very long, Margaret's extended cut suffers from some filler. Moments come and go without adding much to the plot. That said, as the film is attempting to replicate real life, these moments are pretty easy to make sense of in the world of the film. Though everything may not advance the plot, the plot is merely an excuse to study Lisa and what makes her tick. This examination works as a large examination of teenagers and their place in the world. For Lonergan, the world is dark and depressing. Teenagers may wish they were older and try to put themselves in adult situations (losing their virginity and having sex), but the realities of adulthood (abortion, death, pain, loneliness, and injustice) will show them that being an adult is not easy. By the end, Lisa has realized this and shows her mother long overdue affection. Sadly, it comes as a result of her losing her innocence and optimism."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

From great dialogue to great characterization to a great story, Brave’s script is all that I can ask for from a film. Additionally, the film is well paced and even when it establishes its story, Brave never slows down and keeps you entertained throughout.

carnage-2011;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;Jan 12, 2017;"[ ""Adapted from a play, Carnage is set in a single room and is a dramatic and uproariously comical black comedy-drama from director Roman Polanski. Bringing together two couples who have to discuss an incident between their respective sons, the civilized encounter quickly turns nasty and shows the carnage of the situation between their sons. Opening wounds regarding their marriages, lives, and characters, the encounter soon descends into chaos with in-fighting and larger revelations about the world around us with the carnage extending far beyond expectations. Set in just the living room of one of the couple's homes with some scenes in the bathroom and hallway, the film is easily identified as a play, but is one hell of a play translated to film. One of the greatest accomplishments of the film, however, is how it characterizes each person. While the acting is exemplary, the characters are feasts for the eyes and have a lot of meat on their bones. This is largely examined when each is put on the hot seat and attacked by the other three people in the room, with the person on the hot seat constantly changing. What is crucial, however, is how fake each person is, which becomes apparent quite quickly."", ""The person who wants the meeting the most is undeniably Penelope Longstreet (Jodie Foster). Married to Michael (John C. Reilly), her self-righteous, savior of the world persona becomes readily apparent in her interactions with Alan Cowan (Christoph Waltz). Constantly dramatizing his words and editorializing them, the attack on her child by the Cowan's boy is clearly seen as a personal affront because she sees the world in a particular way. As she describes, she is a believer in a civilized world with a set rule of law where violence has no place. Everybody else, however, has there point of difference on this stance and Penelope's superiority complex is constantly derided. Foster does a great job capturing both the defensiveness and perplexed nature of the character. Clearly an educated white liberal (I am independent, so this is not an attack on politics), Penelope seems to have operated in an echo chamber all her life with a husband who just gives up rather than fight her. As such, she is shocked to see anybody dare to trivialize the turmoil in Africa - which she has never seen first hand - in favor of issues that impact their immediate lives instead. She is prim, proper, and to the point, unafraid to express her opinion. The way in which the character is written feels incredibly authentic. The script by Yasmina Reza and Polanski really highlight what is important to this character when Nancy Cowan (Kate Winslet) pukes on her coffee table. Though she later apologized, Penelope freaks out that Nancy puked on her one-of-a-kind art magazine or something. Valuing culture above all else - family included - Penelope pretends to be conscientious of the world around her, but is just as materialistic and vapid as the rest of us."", ""As for her husband Michael, he is a shockingly cruel man. Killing his daughter's pet hamster Nibbles because he does not like rodents, Michael casually criticizes those who have kids and describes newlyweds as \""poor **** who will wake up to the truth soon enough. Clearly unhappy in his marriage, nihilistic, and cynical about the world around him, Michael is a man whose values may be less clear than the others. Buying tulips to keep up appearances in front of the Cowans even though he does not want to meet with them, he is a guy who values money and displays of wealth. The tulips are a small part of this, but his emphasis on illegal acquired and expensive cigars, the 18-year old malt liquor, and his belief that kids are a drain on the lives of the parents, it is clear he values material wealth. While his wife is more concerned with what the money buys and the culture she lives in, Michael just likes to buy items that show off how much money he has acquired in his life."", ""On the other side of the table are the Cowans. Alan, a successful lawyer in the midst of a legal issue with a pharmaceutical company's unsuccessful drug, is clearly distracted. Constantly on the phone, he is like Michael in that he does not want to be there. He does not value his children and could care less about his son. As the ending shows, his son apologized on his own to the child he hurt. Yet, he casually casts him aside a maniac incapable of emotion and sympathy. He, according to his wife Nancy, delegates all matters of the kids and the home to his wife as that is his role. In this way, he is incredibly paternalistic. The man works and the woman raises the kids. He cannot process other methods of doing things, hence his need to constantly work in order to feel busy and accomplished. Since he barely has the wife and the kids are long gone from him, Alan focuses in on the only element he is good at: providing. As such, he is constantly on the phone and is obsessed with the thing.

shame;9;Spangle;/user/Spangle;Jan  9, 2017;"[ ""A haunting, horrifying, and harrowing portrayal of self-hatred, Shame is a dreadfully melancholy and truly abrasive look at the spiral one can go through when suffering. With an incredible lead performance from Michael Fassbender anchoring Steve McQueen's exploration of sex addiction, self loathing, and depression, Shame is a film unlike many others. It takes real courage to explore sex addiction in a meaningful way, as many write it off as something that is impossible to be addicted to and, as such, not a real addiction. Instead, sex addicts are cast aside as dirty perverts who are the shame of society. As Brandon Sullivan (Fassbender) shows, however, he does not enjoy sex. It is a need. It provides a momentary high and then he comes crashing back down to earth into a rapidly spiraling out of control mire of self hatred."", ""From the very beginning of the film, McQueen adorns his film with shades of blue and gray. Melancholy and depressing colors, Brandon wears a gray jacket with a blue scarf daily. The scenes behind him at home, work, and on the subway, are covered with grays and blues. This colorization truly sets the scene for the film, which is incredibly depressing and a dark look at depression as a whole, both through Brandon and his sister Sissy (Carey Mulligan). In many ways, Sissy is just like Brandon. When he finds her unexpectedly in his apartment, she is in the shower and has no problems with Brandon seeing her naked. The two of them are incredibly open with one another to the point that she has sex in Brandon's bed with him in the other room and makes out with a guy in a cab right next to Brandon. The two know the other is a sexual being, but they have a similarity: they use sex to disguise the pain. Sissy is suicidal with numerous scars on her arms and flirts with jumping in front of a pain. Brandon himself sort of just mopes around the film, rejecting human companionship of any kind in favor of short lasting jolts of sexual energy with random people. For Brandon, he is straight, but will pay for sex, pick up women, watch porn, read porn, or accept sex from men. Anything to get his fix fits the bill and it is how he covers up the pain. Sissy, in the short time we see her, seemingly does the same thing with references to past lovers and an obsession with her current lover. Thus, she is far less fleeting and more concerned with finding long-term connections with somebody who can mend her broken pieces. Unfortunately, she cannot find this person, as she is unable to fix herself first."", ""In its exhaustive sex scenes, Shame may turn off more than a few viewers. However, if you watch the film and go with it, it becomes clear that this is not an erotic film. The sex scenes are depressive. They are cathartic for Brandon as he gets his fix, but it continues to fuel his spiral of self loathing. It is clear he is disgusted with himself. He feels intense shame to the point that he throws out of all his porn magazines, computer, and anything else that is of a sexual nature. He tries to move on and become normal. He goes on a date with a woman from work and tries to be nice without taking her home on the first date. However, once he has sex with her, it does not do it for him. He must get his fix, so he calls up a random girl and has sex with her instead. He follows up it with a threesome towards the end of the film and a random encounter with a guy. Though he does these things, it is not voluntary. Brandon is addicted to sex, yes, but he keeps indulging in this addiction because he cannot stand himself. Looking in the mirror is a tiring task and, when he does, he does not like what he sees. Undeniably, Brandon is suicidal and suffering from intense depression. Sex does not even make him happy, he merely goes through the motions because it has become the norm. Actually meaningful sex is a foreign concept to him and one that is no longer able to perform. Cheap throwaway sex with random women is the only thing that keeps him going. Unfortunately, it only feeds his self-hatred as he becomes even more depressed that he is so alone. His addiction leaves him unable to find a companion for longer than four months or, as is often the case, a single night. It is this spiral that makes the film only slightly one about sex addiction. Rather, it is a film about how people cope. For Brandon, it is via sex (which is certainly addicted to) and it is the only way he can make himself feel. For Sissy, it is through cutting herself and throwing herself into relationships."", ""A tragic and often hard to watch film, Shame shines a lot on the depravity one can do to themselves when they do not love themselves. Brandon Sullivan is one of the most depressed characters in a film in recent years and Fassbender truly brings him to life in a shockingly brilliant performance. Alongside him, Carey Mulligan breathes life into Sissy, who is equally as depressive as her brother. Together, they make one somber and melancholy duo."" ]";0;0;0;0;1;0

Some really, really, great dialogue and scenes can be found in this one. Truly a great work on that front. For the acting, it was also stellar. George Clooney is great as always, but to me, the show was stolen by Shailene Woodley.

A great blend of character study, development, and comedy, Young Adult may be a bit depressing for some, but is a great look at a deeply troubled woman trapped in adolescence due to mental illnesses. Theron brings this woman to life and makes you simultaneously hate, pity, and sympathize with her along the way as she embarrasses herself left and right along her path towards self-destruction. With Reitman's other films, namely Thank You for Smoking and Juno, I wound up being a fan from the very first shot. Young Adult was very different and actually took some warming up along the way. However, it is hard to deny such terrific dramatic and comedic writing, especially when they are blended together in a film such as this. Overall, Young Adult is a character study.

The direction from Woody Allen is very good and the writing is strong for the most part, though it does falter at times. However, I loved the unique idea here as this one is not really a romantic film in the traditional sense. Rather, it is a love letter to Paris, the past, and the present. A unique film in which a man is able to travel back in time at midnight in Paris, this one shows a man come to terms with who he is and where he is in life by going back in time. Throughout, many scenes are filmed a gorgeous golden filter to them, which gives a feeling of \""perfection\"" and the \""golden age\"" that is allured to many times throughout the film, which provides this film with quite the luscious look to it.

A tale of love and loss, A Single Man is blessed with fantastic cinematography that really makes its lush style come to life and gentle writing and direction from Tom Ford to give us this worthy character study that feels as if it rings entirely true.

On top of that, it sports a fantastic performance from Ben Foster, as well as Woody Harrelson. Both of them really steal the show and sweep you off you feet as you entirely believe they are both heavily damaged men dealing with their own demons. On the surface, The Messenger is a film about an injured war veteran (Foster) being assigned to casualty notification duty with a hard as nails Captain (Harrelson). However, it is truly about their relationship and themselves as individuals as they learn more about one another and the other sees what troubles them. It is a very well done character study that is entirely moving in its subject matter and the way it handles this subject matter. The Messenger feels like a small film at times, but at others, it feels entirely grand and is very well done.

The special effects were also incredibly cool, but were not the focus, rather the focus of this one was on the story and Rockwell, to great effect.

Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are brilliant in the leads, while Michael Shannon repeatedly stole scenes here in a stellar performance. This film's writing is out of this world as it crafts some seriously deep characters with relatable personas and, somehow, all of this relationship tension really makes the hairs on the back of your neck stand. Somehow Mendes managed to craft almost a thriller at times with the way the drama here made you sit on the edge of your seat waiting to see what happened next. Ultimately, Revolutionary Road is a gut punch that picks you up and punches you in the gut repeatedly. It is a film that will leave you feeling entirely depressed, but damn is it ever a good movie with even better acting and writing.

Director Sam Raimi creates a thoroughly unsettling atmosphere and a great accompanying score and sound effects really help to create that mood. Drag Me to Hell was heavily criticized upon its release for being too silly and not being scary enough. I disagree on both accounts. Obviously I thought it was scary, but I never found any of it comedic. There were moments that broke the tension and were kind of funny, but that happens in every movie. Here, the few funny moments were intended and the scary moments were effective. This is not some cheesy horror-comedy mash-up, this is just regular old horror and a creepily unsettling one at that."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

Incredibly weird and at times almost unsettling, Synecdoche, New York is a tough nut to crack. However, before moving into my interpretation, let me discuss what I love so much. The direction, for one, is brilliant. Charlie Kaufman truly made his vision for this film into his own and in just one film, he has become one of my favorite directors.

Not only are our individual struggles not unique, but they are widespread. Everyone will go through all of those things in their life and while it may feel incredibly important to us in the moment, in the grand scheme of things, it means very little if anything at all. However, this sense of importance is what makes life almost like a play. After thinking about what I thought the film meant, I saw a quote by Shakespeare that essentially said that we are all the lead in our play, which is also something mentioned in the film itself. As depicted in the film with the continuous casting of new actors in the protagonist's play and the growing scope of the set, we all come together and play a role in the play that is life. We all mean something different to every person we come across and play many different roles in our life and embody many different personas."", ""**SPOILERS END**"", """", ""But, what do I know?

Sean Penn is a revelation here as he completely becomes the titular character and brings a certain charisma and charm to the role that demonstrates brilliantly why Milk was a popular figure amongst all citizens. Often times, biopics struggle to be truly engaging and entertaining due to its events actually occurring. This is most certainly not an issue with Milk as it is a brilliantly entertaining film from beginning to end and hits you with every emotional uppercut in its story with full force.

It may not be the scariest horror movie ever, but it definitely is a horror movie that has a deep respect for the genre. Tomas Alfredson does a fantastic job with the direction of this one, crafting a film that rides on atmosphere and tension when it does create scares, but he also shows a great non-reliance on scaring his audience outright. Rather, he is willing let you into the world's of the protagonists and see them for the disturbing (yet innocent) individuals they truly are. For a vampire movie, it also managed to not be very gory, which I appreciate. There is some blood obviously and some pretty gruesome scenes, but they are minimal and do not last long.

rachel-getting-married;9;Spangle;/user/Spangle;Feb 21, 2017;"[ ""Utter brilliance. Born straight out of cinema verite and Dogme 95, Jonathan Demme's Rachel Getting Married opens with a scene reminiscent of Jean-Luc Godard's Breathless in which Kym (Anne Hathaway) is picked up from rehab by her father Paul (Bill Irwin). Putting the camera in the car and immediately making the audience an intimate part of this story and this family, this sequence uses a few jump cuts akin to that Godard film and the plot that plays out feels like a spiritual successor to Thomas Vinterberg's The Celebration. Putting Kym in the throws of her sister Rachel (Rosemarie Dewitt) getting married, the resultant film is powerful, engrossing, and a  truly brilliant experience. The decision to use cinema verite - documentary-style filmmaking - as the main source  of camerawork in Rachel Getting Married is an absolutely brilliant choice by Demme. Instead of just a film about a recovering drug addict arriving home and causing chaos wherever she goes, Rachel Getting Married is an intimate experience. The pain of the characters becomes our pain. Awkward moments are felt. We cry, we laugh, we smile, and we get angry with the characters. All out of love. By the end of the film, this family has become our own. Spending two hours with them feels like a lifetime, as the audience is given such an intimate look at their struggles, past pain, and joy. These characters on display in Rachel Getting Married are beautifully written and achingly real. The situations they find themselves are equally so. By using the documentary-style filmmaking, we are the one's holding the camera. Floating by without fear of using extreme close-ups - which have the added benefit of making us feel even closer to the action - the camera is a tool of intimacy in the film and one that creates a world so authentic, so within reach, it is as if we are not just a fly on the wall. The audience has become a silent family member, sitting by and watching the action unfold without feeling the need to speak out. This manifests itself in making the film feel personal and the characters are our family. I want to reach out to Kym, see how she is doing. Call Rachel and ask how the marriage is and what she is up to nowadays. How is the baby? I want to call Paul, just chat about music or whatever. Rachel Getting Married turns itself into the Buchman family's own home video and one that fills the audience with odd feelings of nostalgia and familiarity."", ""What truly helps to sell the authenticity and broken reality of the film is the acting. As the broken Kym, Hathaway is a revelation. Raw and immature, her Kym is self-centered, self-loathing, and eternally depressed. Responsible for the death of her younger brother because of her drug addiction, she will never forgive herself, further feeding into her spiral into drugs and alcohol. She is a beautiful soul, but one that will never blossom to her potential because of her past sins. Hathaway plays a recovering drug addict that, in spite of how many times she missteps during the film, makes you root for her. The audience can see her good heart and her desire to forgive herself, but she can simply not get over that mountain and continuously acts out to try and cry out for help. Hathaway is brilliant is portraying this complex and deeply moving character."", ""Yet, her family is also at the top of their game. As her father Paul, Bill Irwin is tremendous. Emotional and constantly trying to parent Kym, knowing how fragile she is, Paul is a good man but has trouble forgiving his daughter for being under the influence, leading to the death of his young son. Outwardly, he forgives her, but you can see just how much Ethan's death hurts him and merely seeing his name causes him to breakdown mentally and emotionally. Along the same lines, Kym's sister Rachel is terrifically brought to life by Rosemarie Dewitt. Elated over her marriage and completely loving towards her sisters, she is constantly driven to the edge by her sister's antics. As Kym self-destructs and draws attention to herself, Rachel is driven away, but never leaves. She always comes back, culminating in a beautiful hug shared between them at the end. Chills. No matter what they go through, they will always be sisters and the both of them will go to the end of the world for one another. Of all the film's accomplishments, this portrayal of sisterhoods may be one of its most defiant triumphs. Authentic and showing how one can go between loving and hating their troublesome siblings in an instant, it is never exploitative and never feels scripted. These are real people and scenarios that are merely being reenacted for this film."", ""What reveals the brilliance of Rachel Getting Married, however, is the final shot. Parking the camera on the porch as Rachel looks out at the remaining wedding guests the day after as they gather around a man playing a guitar, it is a scene that makes you want to walk out there with Rachel."" ]";0;0;0;0;1;0
hellboy-ii-the-golden-army;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;Sep 20, 2017;"[ ""A thrilling and fantastical return to the Bureau of Paranoramal Research and Defense, Hellboy II: The Golden Army is far less gothic than its predecessor and, in focusing more on the fantasy element, is a great improvement on its already strong first entry. Far more in Guillermo del Toro's wheelhouse as more of a fantastical fairy tale with fairies, elves, and children reading those very same fairy tales, Hellboy II: The Golden Army starts off with informing the audience about the war between humans and elves. Born with a hole in their heart that is filled with earthly possessions, humanity sought to wipe out every other being on Earth. The only ones standing in their way were the elves who raised a golden army that was indestructible. Destroying the humans in numbers that disturbed the Elf King, a truce was reached for the elves to stay in the forest with two pieces of the golden crown that controls the Golden Army and the humans to stay in the cities with one piece of the crown. However, when elvish Prince Nuada (Luke Goss) returns and is determined to raise the Golden Army to wipe out humanity, it is on Hellboy and the gang to save the world once again."", ""Central to this work is the role of Hellboy and his other supernatural friends in this world of humanity. However, it is largely through the guise of exploring those who are different. In his work, Del Toro is known for exploring creativity, fairy tales, those with their heads in the clouds, and those who are different from others for these reasons - namely Pan's Labyrinth and now again in The Shape of Water, as examples - and here, in Hellboy II, he firmly establishes this group as one of outsiders. Hellboy is equated to Frankenstein's monster as the people accuse him of harming a child even though they can plainly see he did not. Abe Sapien is equated to the Creature from the Black Lagoon. Liz (Selma Blair) feels \""looked at\"" and scrutinized due to her fire-based abilities. The trio feel excluded and like outsiders to the world around them, yet they fight for this world all the same. Though they feel rejected and like outcasts, their wish to fit in is one that overwhelms them. Yet, at the core of it all, is their belief that there should be no boundaries. Abe falls in love with the Elf Princess. Hellboy and Liz are in love. There is inter-species romance in the air and this eclectic group of weirdos embrace these differences. Though rejected by the humans, they nonetheless fight for them because they love their differences, respect them, and wish to protect them and their culture when it is under attack."", ""It is for this same reason that Hellboy struggles to kill a god of the forest and, later, the dangerous elf Prince. Waging war on the humans to maintain their own culture, the elves' cause is one that Hellboy sympathizes with entirely. The prince plays on this sympathy and continuously tries to win him over to his side, warning that the humans will never accept him and his differences. Yet, to Hellboy and the others, the humans are not the ones waging war. Though they may, that is not their concern in the present. Rather, no matter what pull they feel to defend the elves, they must defend those that they are entrusted to protect and those that have remained peaceful to other species in recent times. In the end, for this bad of misfits, the most important thing is acceptance, peace, and understanding. Those who wage war must go as their anti-cultural beliefs are ones that do not gel with them - see the Nazis in the first film - and though they wish to fight for all cultures to remain, there is a line to not cross that the elves have very flippantly disregarded."", ""In this regard, the film perfectly uses the \""end of the world\"" trope that has often maligned superhero films in recent years. Though the elvish prince does wish to unleash the Golden Army on humanity that would certainly wipe them out, the film has it all make sense. Rather than some nonsensical plot where it becomes clear that the villain has nothing but blood lust, the backstory and development of the elvish prince allows us to understand his plight perfectly. As a result, he is a strong villain as though reject his actions, his reasoning and cause are ones that are rather noble. Viewing his father's actions as ones that have eliminated the elves from the world, he wishes to restore his culture as one to be proud of and one that instills great respect wherever it travels. His violent ways are not the right path, but his cause makes sense and his method of rectifying these wrongs make sense as well. In essence, it often doubles as a symbol of nuclear warfare. With certain destruction of the enemy when using the Golden Army, one must exercise great caution in using the weapon. Yet, as with the Americans and Soviets, the elvish prince is fighting for a way of life and a culture. He is willing to press the red button and unleash the army to do so. As a result, he must be stopped even if his"" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

It also does not hurt if you have had a loved one in this situation, as this film certainly hits home for many.

The suspense and thrills of the spy genre are also here and in full force. This one manages to keep you on the edge of your seat without multiple action sequences and shootouts. It is a film built on tension and shows you how to create it without those scenes. As such, the direction from Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck is great, as is the script from him. Both his direction and the writing are top-notch. As with all foreign films, the fact that is in another language can be a barrier of entry for some, but for me, this one felt like it was in English. I barely even noticed they were speaking German I was so engrossed in the story. In addition, the ending is fantastic and really brings everything to a wrap nicely. As a whole, this one is deserving of the praise it has received and stands as one of the best spy films of the past 10 years."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0
the-bourne-ultimatum;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;Jul  9, 2016;"[ ""For me, The Bourne Ultimatum is the best film in the original Bourne trilogy. While the shaky cam can certainly be a bit too much at times, the film is just so well done otherwise that it is impossible to ignore. Matt Damon turns in a traditionally top-notch performance in his famed role as CIA assassin Jason Bourne. However, the direction from Paul Greengrass is what takes centerstage. Well paced, thrilling, and well told the film is never hard to follow, which is impressive. For many action spy films, the number of moving parts can become truly overwhelming. Under Greengrass' assured direction, however, this is never a problem. Instead, the story is coherent and truly entertaining. As with the other Bourne films, the action is stylish and well choreographed and firmly establishes Mr. Bourne as a man you do not want to encounter. Overall, The Bourne Ultimatum is a thrilling and brilliantly executed film that improves upon its predecessors in the Bourne trilogy."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0
harry-potter-and-the-order-of-the-phoenix;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;Aug 13, 2017;"[ ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix finally delivers on the promise of the series. The fifth entry in the beloved saga set in Hogwarts, Order of the Phoenix continues the trend of directors changing in this beloved franchise. Yet, for the first time, a director finally corrects the issue plaguing the success of the films: the length. Streamlining the story and focusing only on the portions that actually impact the story and the climactic battle, Yates turns Order of the Phoenix into far-and-away the best film in the franchise thus far. Able to focus on the story, use the already established characters perfectly, and introduce new ones into the fold, Yates is able to make this a sequel less rooted in the series' original innocence and youth, but rather a far more mature effort out of pure necessity. No longer able to stick their head in the sand and refuse to see what is going in the world around them, the students of Hogwarts must grow up and take charge when the adults will not. As such, their youth is becoming abridged and they must grow up overnight. In Order of the Phoenix, they are able to do just that."", ""In narrowing duff the fluff and childish elements such as the Quidditch, Yates is able to make Order of the Phoenix a strong thematic work. Dealing with numerous themes, the film may be a bit obvious in their dealings with characters coming right out and saying what it all means, but the film nonetheless handles it well. Plus, its overt and blunt nature can be easily explained by the audience it is targeting: young teens. Ensuring that they get the message about good and evil being in all of us, leaving it up to us to decide what to become, is heard and understand far exceeds any need for subtlety. That said, strong writing and acting - especially from Gary Oldman and Michael Gambon who are largely tasked with pointing Harry in the right direction by way of the film's themes - make the themes rousing and powerfully realized. Watching Harry struggle between both sides and having to rely upon his friends and their love for him to overcome it all is powerful, moving, and incredibly resonant. Where the film could become preachy or cloying, it instead becomes a momentous achievement for a franchise seeking firm footing. In Yates, it finds this with the man able to balance the youth of the characters with the wisdom they must possess to succeed that will tear away their innocence."", ""In exploring its themes of good and evil, the film draws an interesting parallel to Lucifer in its depiction of Lucius Malfoy (Jason Isaacs). His name is obviously a dead giveaway of this fact, but as he tempts Harry with the ability to see and rule over the world, it becomes rather interesting. As a death-eater, Lucius does the bidding of Voldemort, so then how could he be Lucifer? While odd on the surface, it makes a lot of sense. Lucifer is like any other being swayed by evil and temptation. Once good, he is led astray to becoming more evil than good and seeks to destroy others along with himself. Yet, absolute evil - or, in the context of the film, Voldemort - led to him to betray himself and his honor. In portraying Lucius/Lucifer as merely a supporter of the absolute evil in the film, Order of the Phoenix shows some subtle nuance that is unexpected, but smartly constructed."", ""However, this show is really all about the battle. With Yates' approach focusing on important details to the plot over developing already developed characters, Order of the Phoenix manages to efficiently and strongly build-up to its climax. With Rocky-esque montages defining the opening hour of this film as the students learn the Dark Arts to defend themselves from Voldemort, Order of the Phoenix constantly builds to the moment where it puts those students in the position to actually use their newly developed skills. Furthermore, with the depth of their training and the constant ominous dread regarding Voldemort's return lurking in the background, it is hard not to get caught up in the tension and thrill of what is upcoming. When the climactic battle finally arrives, it lives up to every bit of tension and anticipation in both this film and the series as a whole. Exciting and leaving you on the edge of your seat, the only word to accurately describe this battle is \""epic\"". In scope, feeling, and design, every bit of this battle is epic. As the kids run through the building and fight the Death-Eaters, as the Order of the Phoenix arrives to fight the Death-Eaters, and as Voldemort and Dumbledore square off with one another, the film delivers thrills and excitement like the series has yet to see. In the first five films, it is hard to find a better constructed scene in terms of fight choreography, special effects, or in direction. It is a thrilling cap to the film that satisfies the tension of this film and builds additional amounts up for its successors. It is the kind of sequence that makes you crave more time in the Wizarding World."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

Director Steven Soderbergh incorporates so much period detail to this 1940s noir throwback, it almost hurts. Aside from the actors (who make it obvious the film is from the 2000s), the film looks entirely like a film from the 1940s. The lighting, quality, editing, and story structure, are 100% 1940s noir. Additionally, the costume and production design are very good and are quite period accurate for 1940s Germany. In terms of acting, Cate Blanchett steals the show. She is absolutely brilliant as usual. Clooney also does a good job here. Much criticism was placed on the characterization, but I thought the characters were fine. They had well explained pasts, goals, and characteristics. I could not really ask for much more on that front. In terms of the story, it was wholly engrossing. The mystery was truly mysterious and I did not know how things would wind up or what the big reveals would actually state. To me, the film's plot almost threatens to steal the show over the style because it is that interesting and engaging. It can be hard to follow at times, but things do clear up and you are able to catch up no problem.

The film depicts the after effects of a nuclear tests that has resulted in huge killer ants. Apparently, after years of being stepped on and killed with ant bait, the species was pissed at humans and were not afraid to show it. 52 years later, the same phenomenon arose in South Korea. Except, it presented the chance for fish to exact their revenge on humanity after millenia of being prey. And exact revenge is certainly the only thing this fish monster is interested in. Created as a result of an American scientist's unwillingness to properly dispose of formaldehyde, this fish is out to wreak havoc on the race that brought it into existence in the name of all of its fish friends. The Host is a truly thrilling, emotionally moving, oddly funny, and expertly executed science fiction film with clear political undertones."", """", ""Often times, films such as that offer some emotional moments wind up being far too sentimental. Bong Joon-ho avoids this trap by showcasing real, raw emotion. The pain showcased by all of the characters and the family bonds that are tested through these traumatic events bring an incredible sense of realism. These moments are not overdone or overly emotional. Rather, they are impassioned, low-key, and subtle. What is not subtle, however, is the love held by Park Gang-du (Song Kang-ho) for his daughter Park Hyun-seo (Go Ah-sung). The two's love for one another as father and daughter is terrifically developed and feels authentic to the point that when things go awry for the two, your heart bleeds for them."", """", ""The emotional authenticity is just one solid element of this film, as the entirety of the characters are well developed. Though there is not a ton of depth given the type of film this is, what is introduced is always purposeful and used later on in the climax. This is emblematic of how tight this film is with very little filler, both in dialogue and in the general plot. The film shows us what it needs to in order for us to understand what is occurring. There are very few, if any, moments that really feel out of place or do not add to the story. While every scene is obviously not perfect, they all have a purpose and flow together incredibly well. Heck, even the odd moments of comedy tossed in the film, particularly in the refugee camp, work out pretty well and do showcase elements of the characters."", """", ""Cinematography-wise, there are a few scenes that stood out to me as being particularly well shot, namely the shot during the protest as agent yellow is released. The shot of the group of people standing with \""Free Park Gang-du\"" shirts and being overtaken by agent yellow is tragic and beautifully executed. The shot itself is incredibly well framed with terrific use of color. Additionally, the final shot of the snack bar set against the ocean as snow falls to the ground was incredibly beautiful."", """", ""Politically, the message is clear: Bong Joon-ho does not like American or outside influence in South Korea. The military, American personnel in Korea, the doctors, and even the CDC are all shown negatively for exploiting the Koreans and not caring about what happens to them. Instead, they are shown as being more obsessed with Americans, their needs, and how it will effect the United States should any possible monster or virus appear in North America. The name \""agent yellow\"" especially drives this home as it draws a direct link to Agent Orange in Vietnam and the disastrous effects it had on the Vietnamese and Americans in the country. Though Americans may not be literally killing Koreans at this point, it is clear that Bong Joon-ho is fearful that if their present level of indifference continues, the day in which Koreans die because of Americans is not far off. Thus, the film is not explicitly anti-American to me. Rather, it is a warning of what could happen and something that both sides should be aware of and planned ahead for."", """", ""As a whole, The Host provides thrills, emotion, and political overtones in this film about a fish monster killing people and taking them hostage (presumably to eat later). Though imperfect as it does have some iffy pacing at times and the ending feeling a little fortunate, The Host is still an incredibly tight and thrilling experience offered by Bong Joon-ho. Somehow, this is only my second film from him (Snowpiercer being the other). Clearly, I need to see more, even if Snowpiercer was just okay."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

Every shot is more beautiful than the next, thanks in large to the beautiful and picturesque scenery. The acting from leads Edward Norton and Naomi Watts is top-notch and their chemistry is very good with one another. Toby Jones also has a good supporting role here. For all of them, they got to play very well developed and multi-faceted characters, a bonus for them and a key element to what makes this one a success, as the script is very well done. In addition, the love story is well done. I am not typically overly into romantic films, but this one is definitely different as the romance feels real and not cheesy at all. All of these elements also feel realistic for the time period depicted and really makes it feel like an authentic portrayal of a man and a wife who are going through troubled times with one another. Finally, the film is very interesting, it never really failed to have my interest. Yes, it is slow and methodic, but it is a gorgeous film to watch and take in and never really heads towards \""boring\"" for me.

The characters are all really well done, but above all, the film is a ton of fun. As with all Edgar Wright films, they are well made and well written, so they meet those requirements for a good film and then they are entertaining, so you get to watch something that is really well put together and is fun to watch. A win-win, really. The action is as over the top as it should be in this one, as it is intended to be comedic and boy is it ever.

Nolan is really on the top of his game here. Bale and Jackman were also great leads and while they were not in a ton of scenes together, they were undoubtedly dominated the screen.

A truly haunting and, at times, scary film Apocalypto thrills with ease thanks to the great direction from Mel Gibson. Though it can be historically inaccurate and disrespectful towards the Mayans at times, it does paint a sympathetic portrait of some factions of the civilization, including that which our hero belongs. The film really paints a mysterious picture of the current events plus those to follow, with there being a significant swell of unease amongst the people in the film as they are unsure of what their future will hold. Additionally, the film has incredible mise en scene with great use of lighting and, similar to Gibson's The Passion of the Christ, a film that can be told through the eyes and the visuals. The subtitles are needed, but not required in this relatable table of survival and fear. The costumes and make-up are fantastic, as is the camera work and production design. Gibson really ensures that the beauty of this scenic location is brought to life against this backdrop of sheer horror. Gibson does a great job keeping a hold of this film from going off the rails with the complex situations of the society and with the excessive violence. Overall, Apocalypto is a thrilling and exciting film that really does become moving at times with its portrayal of desperation, but above all, entertains and delivers artistically."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

I simply cannot describe to you how gorgeous this film is without having you sit down and watch it. The visuals alone make this a crowning achievement in cinema and undoubtedly a crowning achievement for Darren Aronofsky, who's vision for this film comes through load and clear and was a resounding success.

While I think it could have been less compiicated, I am more content with the way it is currently. It is hard for me to understand the criticism aimed at this one.

The depiction of the horrors inflicted on the people of Sierra Leone (and, really, Africans everywhere) through civil wars and the harvesting of diamonds is brutal to watch, but very well done all the same. In addition, the brutality of the diamond companies is not forgotten either as they are shown to be just as evil as those actually doing the killings in these countries. However, what this one does really well is that even as a social issue film, it never feels preachy. It tells you its points, but it does so in a way that is obnoxious or annoying, which can be an issue with films of this type. Ultimately, this one deserves the praise it gets from regular old viewers, but the critics were a tad too harsh here for my taste.

marie-antoinette;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;Jan  5, 2017;"[ ""A tale of decadence and elegance, Marie Antoinette is not your run-of-the-mill biopic period film. Instead, director Sofia Coppola opts to show how to properly light up the night in 18th century France. Complementing the constant party and gossip is modern pop rock that infuses the film with a modern take that matches the extravagant unconventionality of Marie Antoinette. Right down to this music, this film is about the life of Marie Antoinette. Guillotined as part of the French Revolution, Coppola's film ends before this and includes no addendum at the end of the film revealing the fate of its characters. While the film itself is hardly historically accurate, this move is deliberate and underscores what Coppola's film is about: her life, not Marie Antoinette's death or reality. She merely takes moments of her life, exaggerates them, or creates them in order to paint a picture of who Marie Antoinette was, both the good and the bad."", ""Decried by French critics for not criticizing Marie Antoinette's (Kirsten Dunst) life of luxury, it only feels fair that the film does not do this. Criticized endlessly in her life for her expensive taste, inability to consummate her marriage (not her fault), and being an Austrian in France, it is about time somebody not overtly criticize the woman. Whether she was nice or not, she certainly had her positive elements and, in the film, was dedicated to her people and her children. She never acted within hostility towards others and did not partake in the catty gossip that permeated the palace. Now, of course, the film does show her decadence, vapidness, and affair, which cast a shadow on her. While it does not chastise these actions, their inclusion shows that the film is fair and balanced when it comes to its main character."", ""Of course, the film is not completely fair when it comes to the people of France. But, honestly, who cares? Marie Antoinette is a film about flair and party. Sofia Coppola embraces this by ignoring history and focusing upon the style of the film and the lavish costume design. Decked head to toe in diamonds, this is a film about excess. Described as a satire or a comedy, the film embraces this with its tongue placed firmly along its cheek when critiquing palace life throughout. For example, a scene where Kirsten Dunst stands naked awaiting somebody to dress her, but she must be dressed by the highest ranking person in the room. Unfortunately, this keeps changing as more and more people walk into the room. Incredibly comical, this scene underscores the comedic tone of the film, which is subtle but ever present. At all times, Coppola eschews the serious tone of many historical films in favor of a light take on a serious subject. Often times, this will fail, but it somehow finds a way to work in this film. Thus, by embracing the decadence of the royal family, Coppola finds absurdity through the parallel created by their extravagance and the poverty of the French people and the debt situation."", ""Visually, Marie Antoinette is stunning. With breathtaking cinematography that made me physically angry with how beautiful it was, the film's visuals are tremendous. Repeated shots of the stairs leading up to the palace, long shots from and of the palace, and shots of men riding horses from a distance, this film is incredibly gorgeous. Of course, what helps this is the lavish color scheme. Blending a variety of colors, the colors in the film are largely introduced by the costumes. With elegantly crafted costumes that burst with flair and color, Marie Antoinette is a gorgeously dressed film that visually defines the wealth and power of the French royal family at the time. By the end, when the French people revolt, it is not hard to see how they could find issue with the family's display of wealth."", ""One of the more compelling elements of this film, however, is the gossip. With Marie Antoinette constantly surrounded by the catty gossip of the palace. The impact of this is a claustrophobic environment that shows the shallowness of the courtroom. As she and other women of the court are constantly under examination and inspection with absurd expectations abounding, the film finds even more entertainment. With the gossip feeling oddly modern and akin to a high school clique, this is where Coppola turns the film almost into a historical Mean Girls. Those surrounding Marie Antoinette are more cruel and judgmental towards her and others than the people who eventually would have her beheaded in the revolution. Of course, there is also comedy in these high expectations as the King (Rip Torn) has a mistress and she is forced upon the women of the court. The women are appalled by her and her conduct, even though they themselves have sex and there is a constant obsession with getting Marie Antoinette to consummate her marriage with Louis XVI (Jason Schwartzman). Coppola does not shy away from showing this absurdity of expectation with Louis being the one afraid to have sex"" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

If you do not like his comedic style, Scoop will not be the film for you, but I find Woody Allen hysterical and Scoop is no exception. The comedy here is A+ and the mystery/romance element live up to that standard with a solid romance story and a captivating mystery that keeps you guessing from beginning to end as to how it will all turn out.

However, throughout the film, we get to see his great interactions with the bears and foxes he encounters, while we also see a lot of comedy from Treadwell, which was unexpected. In spite of how tragic the film is at its core, there was enough humor to not bum you out with how Timothy's life ends. On top of this, Herzog's gentle direction really allowed the tapes made by Treadwell to speak for themselves (with a little narration from Herzog) and overall, it leaves you realizing that this man simply loved the grizzly bears and while he may be a little odd, he is oddly endearing and admirable."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

In addition, the set design for 1930s New York/New Jersey is great and feels very authentic.

Thus, in that way, this one reminds you of the magic of film, as even though it may not be the most technically brilliant film or the best one ever, it makes you care and feel something even when you know what is coming next due to the type of film it is.

ben-hur-1959;9;Spangle;/user/Spangle;Apr 25, 2017;"[ ""The most expensive film ever made at the time of its release, Ben-Hur has found a lasting legacy as the definitive Biblical epic alongside Cecil B. DeMille's The Ten Commandments. Many Christian families gather around at least once a year to watch either one or possibly both. A film of epic proportions, it is easy to see why this film resonates so deeply with both believers and non-believers alike. Telling the story of Jesus Christ's time on Earth before his crucifixion at the hands of the Romans, the film take a far more intimate approach compared similar Biblically-based films. As opposed to even DeMille's epic film or more modern takes on Christ in films such as The Last Temptation of Christ or Passion of the Christ, Ben-Hur tells the story of Jesus through the eyes of others. Aside from a few brief frames, his face is never shown. His sermon on the mount is briefly shown, but is limited to just depicting the crowds gathering around him. Jesus' words are never spoken from his own lips. Rather, it is by word-of-mouth that people hear his words as the gospel is spread throughout the land. This is not a typical Jesus film in that its focus is on a single man, Judah Ben-Hur (Charlton Heston), his family, and his life. The film's power is not derived from the portrayal of Christ, but the portrayal of how his life impacts everybody around him for the better, with the power to change somebody's entire mindset."", ""A wealthy man living in Judea, Judah's life is thrown into turmoil when his old friend Messala (Stephen Boyd) arrives from Rome. The new tribune in Judea, Messala is tasked with quelling the rising tide of religion that has taken a hold in the land with word of messiah having been born. Seeking help from Judah to stomp out those that wish to use violence to overthrow Roman power in the region, Messala is quickly rebuked by Judah who does not wish to inform on his own people. Now sworn rivals, Messala is able to get the assistance he demanded from Judah when Judah's sister accidentally knocks a shingle off of their home that nearly kills the governor. Making an example out of Judah and his family by imprisoning them and sending Judah off to be a slave, Messala sets off a chain of events that will change everybody's lives forever."", ""Relegated to servitude, Judah is left in the dark as to how his sister and mother are doing while imprisoned. He must slave as a rower, but not before encountering Jesus for the first time. With Jesus' role quite limited in the film in terms of appearances, the few times we do see some of him is immediately noteworthy. This encounter, in which Jesus offers Judah a drink of water, is immediately powerful. Watching the son of God stoop down and clean off a dirty man and give him water to drink is moving and shows the film's ability to create that sense of awe and presence that religious films must have when showing Jesus. As time progresses, Judah finds the favor of Quintus Arrius (Jack Hawkins) after saving his life in battle, earning his freedom and becoming Arrius' adoptive son. Afterwards, he sets out to find his family and, simultaneously, embarks on a mission of revenge to find Messala and make him pay for what he did to his family."", ""This hatred that consumes Judah is really what defines this film. It is something he must overcome, but it is a challenge. In the incredible chariot scene, he finally does get to square off with Messala. However, this is a film that pulls no punches. Judah and Messala do not receive a scene where they say sorry and get that cathartic release. Instead, in true Biblical fashion, Judah must forgive the unforgivable. Due to Messala's actions, Judah's mother Miriam (Martha Scott) and sister Tirzah (Cathy O'Donnell), contracted leprosy. How can he be expected to forgive Messala for such a cruel injustice when they did nothing to deserve that treatment? He showed Messala nothing but love, opened his home to him, and gave him a horse. Yet, he gets stabbed in the back. It is this hatred and resentment that spurs Judah to live and not just accept death as a slave. To be free to is to be able to exact his revenge on Messala, an opportunity he refuses to give up on. It is a hatred that invigorates his spirit and gives him the will to go on. However, no matter how passionate it is, this hatred is debilitating. It saps his ability to live and to live well. All-consuming, his hatred for Messala does not die with Messala. Instead, it is Messala's greatest final act of hatred: to make Judah so consumed with hate that he loses sight of God and continues to allow it to dwell in his soul long after Messala is gone. Through his encounters with Christ, however, Judah begins to see the light. Walking away from the sermon on the mount, but running to Christ's aid and giving him water as he carries his cross, Judah begins to feel the power of God. When he sees Jesus dying on the cross, asking for his killers to be forgiven, Judah learns just how misguided he had"" ]";0;0;0;0;1;0
the-deer-hunter;9;Spangle;/user/Spangle;Nov 29, 2014;"[ ""The Deer Hunter truly lives up to the hype and more for me. Absolutely brilliant film. Entirely sombering and one of the most emotionally distressing films I have ever seen. I honestly feel as though I may have PTSD after watching this one, it was just that emotionally powerful and resonant. Many claim that this one is a little slow and overlong, but I never saw that honestly. One of the main points of criticism is the wedding sequence, but if you cannot tell that the joy and happiness in that sequence is meant to directly juxtapose the sadness and emotional turmoil of the rest of the film, I am honestly sad for you, because that is one of the most brilliant pieces of this one. An entirely beautiful sequence, I could honestly watch the wedding for the entire three hours, because at least I would not leave this one feeling emotionally defeated. The Russian Roulette elements, and the characters' transformations from the first one to the final one, are immaculately filmed and just so impactful throughout. The direction from Michael Cimino is truly remarkable, as is the acting from the two true stars here; Christopher Walken and Meryl Streep. Walken steals the show throughout, but Streep's emotionally vulnerable performance (especially considering what was happening in her personal life with John Cazale at the time) is heartbreakingly beautiful and stands tall as one of the best performances in a film littered with them. Finally, the final half hour is pitch perfect filmmaking and, while entirely distressing, just so mesmerizingly perfect you cannot look away. However, in spite of all this, it is a touch long and in terms of war films, I do think Downfall and Saving Private Ryan are superior, though I would rank this one over other Vietnam films such as Apocalypse Now and Full Metal Jacket. As a whole, The Deer Hunter is not for everyone, but I can entirely see why it is a classic and, to me, it deserves to be 100%."" ]";0;0;0;0;1;0

Heartwarming and built around family with childlike wonder, the film also shows Spielberg's great ability to create thrills and scares along the way. Tom Cruise is great in the lead role and really does a great job as the deadbeat dad tasked with saving his kids who do not really like him too much. Dakota Fanning does very well as his daughter, though she does become annoying a few times. The special effects and creature design are incredible, while also demonstrating why everybody is so paranoid. The film also does a great job drawing parallels with historical occupations (French in Algeria, Britain in the United States), while capturing the paranoia of post-9/11 America all in one swoop. Overall, War of the Worlds is a fantastic science fiction film that really is a testament to Spielberg's skill in the director's chair."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

However, when the Spear of Destiny is discovered in Mexico, it sets into motion a series of events that sees the son of Lucifer, Mammon, be summoned back to Earth. The only thing standing in the way of Mammon and any other half-breed demons that seek to try and possess humans is John Constantine (Keanu Reeves). A demon slayer armed with crucifixes, a gold-plated gun in the shape of a cross, and copious amounts of holy water, Constantine is an impure soul. With a soul long ago claimed by Lucifer (Peter Stormare) for his suicide attempt as a young boy, he consistently seeks retribution by deporting demons back to hell in the name of God. With a soul in hell and a spirit in heaven, Constantine is the perfect man to enforce the balance between heaven and hell on Earth that demons consistently test."", ""Found by Angie (Rachel Weisz) after the suicide of her psychic twin sister, Constantine is tasked with restoring the balance between good and evil no matter the costs to himself or others. In waging this holy war against those that wish to sink humanity into the pits of hell, Constantine naturally hopes to seek favor from God in order to make amends for his mortal sin. Yet, in learning from the angel Gabriel (Tilda Swinton) that he is damned and will remain damned, Constantine continues his spiral of self-destruction. Killing himself by smoking cigarettes that have led to terminal lung cancer, Constantine is the quintessential noir protagonist. Cynical, chain smoking, and cooly charismatic, Reeves both damns the world around him in his language, is deeply jaded, and knows how to deliver random bursts of wit with the requisite zip to make the dialogue pop and feel natural. He is the perfect man for this role with the natural charisma to make him appealing, but the dour demeanor that makes his overwhelming cynicism come off authentically."", ""Yet, it is Peter Stormare who steals the show in this film. Appearing for a brief moment towards the end as Lucifer, Stormare's menacing, sadistic, and devilishly terrifying turn as the very embodiment of evil is the highlight of this film. However, it largely becomes the highlight because of Francis Lawrence's smart and strong direction up to that point. While he allows Stormare's Lucifer to command the screen at the end, until the climax we never actually see him. Instead, his presence is allowed to be felt and linger in the actions of the demons and wicked in the world, creating an omnipresent darkness that descends upon the screen throughout the film. By the time we see him, Stormare is practically set up to disappoint with how ominous the film feels in anticipation of seeing Lucifer for the first time. Yet, through his true embodiment of the fallen angel, Stormare is a sinister and truly demonic presence that chews up the scenery and more than lives up to the hype."", ""As a sinner battling for his own soul, Constantine's battle with Lucifer and the demons of the world is most certainly spiritually significant for anybody watching the film. Paralleling and bringing to life the very real battle waged daily by every person alive to ensure that their soul goes to heaven, the film brings to life the demons that stalk the world and sinister dark arts that surround us all. Waging war through religion, putting himself on the line for others, and leaning on the power of God for extra strength are all actions undertaken by John Constantine as he does battle with Mammon, the sinister Gabriel, and Lucifer. By turning to God and using both His word and His promise to humanity as his source of strength, Constantine is able to overcome all evil he encounters, even if it is the natural evil that resides within himself and urges him to sin. He is able to stamp down this temptation and put God first in his heart and mind. Yet, his struggle until the climax highlights the struggle we all face. Being righteous seeking reward through a spot in God's home is not righteous. It is hollow righteous in the name of self-gratification. It is only when he sacrifices himself and opens up his soul to be finally claimed by Lucifer to save another person from hell does he actually receive the forgiveness he had fought for all these years. Through selfless and second nature self-sacrifice, he is able to receive the absolution he has long fought for, but not until then."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

In this aspect, the camera work is phenomenal and really puts you into the film and makes it feel as though you are watching this all unfold. The lack of music is an interesting touch that is honestly unnoticeable. The film did not need a score and did not have one, which really added to the realism of the film as a whole.

The comedy is hilarious and leaves you laughing for much of the film, whether through the intended jokes or the sheer quirkiness of the characters, as in all Anderson films. Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, Jeff Goldblum, Cate Blanchett, Anjelica Huston, and Willem Defoe (especially him), turn in great performances here. The production design is also brilliant as in all Anderson films. The exterior shots at the same time look real and at others look as if it they are all just toys in some child's bedroom with miniature people walking around, which is always the cool part about his films. This one, with the boat's exterior having this look, is no exception. In addition, the shots underwater in the submarine and very well done and extremely cool to look at. As a whole though, the film is beautifully shot as expected and brilliantly put together.

the-phantom-of-the-opera;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;May 12, 2017;"[ ""A film with the music and lyrics provided by Andrew Lloyd Webber could hardly go wrong and Joel Schumacher's The Phantom of the Opera certainly does not take many missteps. While his sense of spectacle can be a bit too flamboyantly gaudy at times, it is hard to deny the visual stimuli on display that Schumacher presents, opting for a bombastic musical akin to Baz Luhrmann's Moulin Rouge!. With raucous crowds, gorgeous production design, and extravagant costume design, The Phantom of the Opera is a lively and inspired musical with excellent performances, solid direction, and phenomenal music that always manages to lift the film up if it ever slacks off. Putting this all into one finished product results in a good musical that is tragic, beautiful, and infused with excellent style."", ""Opening with a black-and-white sequence set in 1919 Paris, the film shows an auction taking place with memorabilia from the opera house being sold. One such item is the infamous chandelier from the night of the disaster, which is sold as item #666. As it is lifted up to be demonstrated, the film beautifully transitions to color with every inch of the frame being absorbed by vibrant golds and reds as the opera house is brought back to glorious life. An inspirational moment from Schumacher to open the film, it may be the creative peak of the film on his part, but it is an undeniably high one and sets the tone from the very beginning: this is a spectacle. The scene immediately following features the first song as delivered by Minnie Driver's Carlotta Giudicelli, who is the prima donna and diva of the opera. Living up to those titles, she is self-absorbed and unafraid to demonstrate how in love with herself she is at every turn. In this opening number, the sensually extravagant choreography and vibrant use of color provide the film with a fittingly loud and wondrous opener. With a lot of visual conflict, Schumacher plays all the right notes from the very beginning of this film creating beautiful chaos in the film's presentation and sea of color. Accompanying this opening number is an introduction to Christine Daae (Emmy Rossum). A beautiful, but unknown, dancer, Christine was raised in the opera house and has been taught to sing by the mysterious Phantom of the Opera (Gerard Butler). Ogled by the male gaze of the camera and of the opera houses new owners, Christine's peril is forcefully thrust into focus as we see her introduced as a talented girl, but one at the behest of dangerous men around every corner. With the Phantom trying to possess her and keep her for his own pleasure as a wife, Christine has her back against the wall. The men of the opera house still do view Carlotta as their lottery ticket, but are certainly taken by Christine's beauty. Meanwhile, the Phantom orchestrates productions to ensure she is the lead singer and tries to keep other men such as Raoul (Patrick Wilson) out of her life. She is a woman left with very little choice as to where to go and what to do in order to live the life she desires. In essence, she continuously finds herself being past the \""point of no return\"" as a result of letting the mysterious Phantom into her life."", ""Her only savior is Raoul. Reigniting a romance with Raoul over the course of the film, the film finds great fire and passion in their love throughout, but the writing certainly does it a disservice at times. The dialogue can be awkwardly presented, especially whenever Raoul comes to save Christine from her lovesick and deeply obsessed Phantom admirer. Fortunately, the music greatly elevates their love scenes with the duets between Emmy Rossum and Patrick Wilson being extraordinary. With snow falling on the roof of the opera as the two serenade one another with \""All I Ask of You\"", Schumacher finds similar glamour in this small, intimate moment. The two's vivacious and impassioned performances creates beautiful harmony that ensures the performance is the best one in the film. The two play off of one another beautifully and both deliver pitch perfect notes. In staging the scene, Schumacher also finds an opportunity to further demonstrate the Phantom's looming presence. Hiding behind a statue and watching the couple sing and dance, the camera often racks focus between the couple and the voyeuristic Phantom. Highlighting the joy of Christine when in the arms of Raoul and the loneliness and isolation experienced by the Phantom, the scene is not just beautifully sung and written, but also terrifically staged and framed."", ""With the death of Christine's father being the event that brought her together with the Phantom as a child, it is only natural that one of the best moments of the film comes with Christine visiting her father's tomb in the cemetery. A gray and blue sequence with mist rising off of the ground as Christine walks to the tomb and sings \""Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again\"", the song is beautifully sung by Rossum."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

The film is never great, so to speak, but it was still very good and, while it needed no help in doing so, did a great job creating suspense when things went wrong, as well as sympathy for the families of the men aboard.

It covers the relevant topics and still touches you in a way only fiction can, a truly challenging task for most biopics. Johnny Depp is fantastic here, as are  Kate Winslet and all of the young Davies boys. The film's magic and sense of wonder it inspires never really ceases, but certainly extends to the overall message of the film that captures the essence of Peter Pan as well; just believe. The film's cinematography is great, especially the final sequence with Sylvia and the score is also very well done.

Nothing extraordinary happens and it is debatable as to if anything happened at all. However, I really do enjoy these type of films for the insight they provide for the characters presented. In Broken Flowers, you really get to really understand Murray's character and his problems and really, you feel bad for him since he is so alone, though he has always been surrounded by people. In addition, Jim Jarmusch's direction is brilliant. He really manages to capture the beauty of life by emphasizing the beauty of the landscape that Murray transverses. Much like life, the beauty is in the details and this film really underscores that. A subtle film that is so subtle it will not really touch a lot of viewers, this one really was moving. On top of that, the comedic moments were well done and actually really funny, but you had to pay attention to catch them.

The film, at every turn, leaves you on the brink of tears with its power as it pulls the back the cover on the Rwandan genocide. At no point did Rwanda receive the level of help they needed from the Western world, which is truly tragic and is touched on repeatedly throughout the film. An absolute indictment of the West and those who let this atrocity happen, Hotel Rwanda is just the Rwandan Schindler's List.

ray;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;Mar 12, 2016;"[ ""A fantastically moving biopic of Ray Charles, Ray is a powerhouse of a film. Jamie Foxx is magnetic as the musical legend and turns in a career-defining performance. Sharon Warren, Kerry Washington, Regina King, and CJ Sanders, are all fantastic as well here, turning in fantastic and authentic performances. Ray is a film packed to the brim with passion and it truly overflows. The music in the film is infectious and fantastically worked into the film and subtle direction from Taylor Hackford really pays off as he allows the music and the actors to really take center stage in this one. Ray also expertly handles balancing Charles' youth, rise to fame, stardom, and struggles, with each carrying the required weight and none of the scenes coming as being filler. Rather, they all presented their own set of positives and really combine to be an entirely moving film. In particular, scenes involving Charles as a boy interacting with his mother got to me the most and were some of the best emotional scenes I have seen in a film in a bit. Overall, Ray is a fantastic biopic that manages to avoid feeling like a generic music biopic by being completely authentic and unwilling to compromise our inside look at Charles' life. Thanks to good direction, phenomenal acting, and strong writing, Ray is a winner."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz are both great in this one, as expected. It is not hard to believe that Weisz won an Oscar for her performance here. The cinematography is also gorgeous as they were able to extract every bit of beauty they could out of their African location. As mentioned, this one is a tad slow, but it never really failed to have my attention. Throughout the film, I was completely hooked as I tried to follow every twist and turn before the big conclusion at the end. The great part about this one is that the second half really does explain much of what we see in the first half. It is a tad confusing, but the answers to any questions we have are ultimately provided and things begin to make a bit more sense. In addition, the film brings a lot of ethical concerns surrounding drug companies and their operations in Africa to the forefront, as you know the plot of this one is not too far-fetched. While the film was very thrilling, it also makes you feel a lot of empathy for those who are exploited in the name of medicine. Ultimately, \""The Constant Gardener\"" is a good film with a strong plot, strong acting, and strong direction."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0
scent-of-a-woman;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;May 17, 2014;"[ ""Charming, funny, and powerful, Scent of a Woman is a good film anchored by a legendary performance from Al Pacino. Without him, this film would be nothing extraordinary. But, with him, it is elevated significantly. Overall, the story is ok and is somewhat compelling, but every line spoken by Pacino are a mixture of emotions. On the surface, many undeniably funny, but it is also hard-hittingly powerful or inspirational, while many of them are simply depressing, as he is a man who thinks he has no further purpose in life. On top of Pacino, Chris O'Donnell does a great job (as does Philip Seymour Hoffman in a small role RIP), making this even more of an acting showcase, rather than a superb film. However, regardless, the film is incredibly enjoyable and endearing as we learn to love Slade (much like Charlie) and all of his little quirks. Plus, his monologue at the end is absolutely phemomenal and really stands as one of the best monologues in film."", """", ""On the negative side of things, it is a tad long. I love getting to see this much of their lives, but if it could be cut down to at least 2:10 rather than almost 2:40, it would be really beneficial. There is really no reason for this one to be so long. Otherwise, Scent of a Woman is a solid film that is lifted to new heights by a bravora performance from a living legend in Al Pacino who continously wows you throughout the film."" ]";0;1;0;1;0;0

To me, that is a non-issue. At face value, this film is very entertaining, very well directed by Alex Proyas, very well acted by Will Smith and Bridget Moynahan, and very interesting when it comes to the questions it raises about creation and robots. It stays relatively constrained and believable when it comes to its science fiction ideas and though this may not be the way things are in 2035, it is relatively believable that this could come to fruition. The few plot twists that are here are also interesting and very much throw you for a loop at times. It is well paced, well written as well, though my main complaint was some blatant product placement for Converse and Audi. These do not usually bother me, but the Converse ones were particularly obvious and clearly shoehorned in later on. Overall, I, Robot is not a seminal science fiction by any means, but is a very, very well made one that entertains in spades and features enough heady thrills and a very well thought out future to make it a very good film."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0
short-cuts;9;Spangle;/user/Spangle;Jan 21, 2017;"[ ""An ambitious, cynical, and character driven film, Short Cuts is loosely plotted, but always engaging. Critiquing modern society, marriages, infidelity, and more, Short Cuts is a film with a ton of moving pieces, courtesy of a variety of storylines. Each storyline and set of characters interacts with others in very natural ways that link their stories. Above all, it really shows how flawed we all are and the fragility, mistrust, and lies, that permeate modern day marriage. Through these vignettes, it quickly becomes clear that Altman has a very cynical opinion towards modern day marriage and people's ability to remain faithful to their spouse and not act in their own self-interest."", ""One of the best portions of this film is the acting. With such a large cast, obviously there are a lot of terrific actors and boy do they every display it in this film. Leading the way is Julianne Moore. As an eccentric artist who largely paints nude women, she portrays Marian Wyman. Married to Dr. Ralph Wyman (Matthew Modine), she and Modine share one of the best scenes in the film. Confronting his wife about an event three years ago when he believes she cheated on him, the moment is intense and incredibly powerful. Moore's performance in this moment really hits a fever pitch of intensity and emotional rawness that define her character. She is very open throughout and even does this scene without her pants, which really shows what makes her character tick. She is raw and a passionate person and Moore really captures this brilliantly, especially in this moment. Alongside her, Jennifer Jason Leigh is often scene stealing here. Appearing as Lois Kaiser, a married mother of two who is a sex line worker, one of the funniest encounters of the film is her talking dirty to a customer, which upsets her husband. Wondering why she does not talk to him like that, her reaction to this apparent absurdity and comical reaction to her work is hysterically put together, bolstered by Leigh's performance."", ""Yet, what is really impressive is the writing. Thinly plotted, the film is never anything less than engrossing. It keeps you fully engaged and entertained throughout because of the writing. The characters are nuanced, with most of them being neither fully good or bad. They all act, talk, and walk like real people. Robert Altman introduces a variety of characters and uses them brilliantly to explore the state of marriage and the turmoil that ensues. Issues regarding infidelity, different desires, lack of passion, death of children, and depression, all ensue and are beautifully depicted. The acting helps here, as it is all very grounded and authentic, but the writing is really what creates this impact. Instead of introducing storylines and dropping them, Altman delves into them and shows them from varying perspectives. In one relationship, a man cheats. In another, the woman cheats. How is the dynamic different? This is explored in Short Cuts, as well as other marital issues that can arise. All are given the heft and weight they demand, which is a real treat to watch unfold."", ""For a three hour long film, Short Cuts honestly feel quite short. Its acting and writing is so engrossing, it never slacks. Compared to Altman's past film of this type, Nashville, it is hypnotic. While Nashville is a great film, it does sometimes feel its length. Short Cuts, however, is streamlined and consistently powerful. That said, the comparisons to Nashville are apt as they are not just Altman films, but both use music in interesting fashions. Through Tess Trainer (Annie Ross) and her singing in a club, which brings a few characters into the bar, we hear songs such as \""To Hell with Love\"" or \""Prisoner of Life\"". Thematically, these are great fits as the film largely explores the pain that can come from marriage and the problems that arise. Yet, having a spouse and kids, as most of the characters do, can leave one feeling trapped and stuck with their current way of life, even if its unhappy. This is a constant in Altman's films and Short Cuts is hardly an exception as, though he explores dark themes here, it is done through music and the musical choices accentuate the thematic excursions."", ""A poetic and moving look at life, marriage, and death, the film explores issues that can arise once we are married. The animosity, loss of passion, or infidelity, that plagues modern marriages are on full display in Short Cuts with brilliant writing and acting to boot, which does its sensitive subject tremendous justice. Honestly, this is as near to a masterpiece as I have seen in my mild binge on Robert Altman in the past few weeks."" ]";0;0;0;0;1;0
hero;9;Spangle;/user/Spangle;Sep 10, 2016;"[ ""A beautiful masterstroke from director Zhang Yimou, Hero is a beautifully constructed wuxia film that is infused with history, Chinese culture, honor, and themes of overcoming hate and the pain that can be caused from not conquering that hate. Through this film, Zhang Yimou not only creates a terrifically entertaining martial arts action film, but he also creates a film that is a moving and stirring look at the unification of China and the sacrifices that went into that monumental step."", """", ""With beautiful cinematography to soak up every inch of the screen, Hero shows an adept use of shot composition and construction to go along with the cinematography. Used in conjunction, the significant moving pieces of each shot and the capturing of those moves creates a truly gorgeous film that is breathtaking to view. From beginning to end, Zhang's film presents a unique and melodic look at its action. Personally, my favorite shot comes when our nameless warrior (Jet Li) enters the palace of the King of Qin (Chen Daoming). The long shots in this sequence are incredible and truly soak up the entirety of the beauty of the location."", """", ""Additionally, Zhang's constant use of color in the film is incredible, namely in the battle between Flying Snow (Maggie Cheung) and Moon (Zhang Ziyi). The changing color of the leaves is an incredible site and the significance unashamedly escapes me, but is a beautiful use of color all the same. When it comes to the battles, the Zhang's use of color emerges continuously and it is always incredible to view."", """", ""Now, of course, the main focus of these types of films are the battle sequences. As the film progresses, each battle sequence takes on new meaning, but is always steeped in Chinese culture and the Chinese concept of honor. These ideals, along with the ideals of a warrior, blend perfectly into terrific choreography of each fight with good special effects throughout. For those unfamiliar with wuxia films, seeing people flying can be a bit much. However, Zhang keeps this supernatural element restrained with a deeply human story and deeply human battles. Though they have unusual abilities, their hearts and souls and apparent for all to see."", """", ""(SPOILERS) Thematically, Hero's beauty is continued with a terrific take on the power of hatred. Driven to assassinate the King of Qin due to the King's killing of his family, the nameless warrior manages to overcome his hatred due to Broken Sword (Tony Leung). Moved by his words, \""Our Land\"", the warrior is unable to kill the King because he now understands the motives behind his attempts to unify China. Though he is killed for this, the scene of their mutual understanding is beautiful and wonderfully scripted. However, the film continues on this theme as it shows Flying Snow kill Broken Sword due to his refusal to kill the King. Upon killing her love, she realizes just what her hate brought her: personal anguish. Zhang's execution of this theme is wonderful to watch and underscores the brilliance of Hero, which transcends borders and is a deeply human film, not just one aimed at Chinese audiences."", """", ""Overall, Hero is a beautifully crafted film that really shows its beauty in its cinematography, color, choreography, and in its themes. This is a masterful film from director Zhang Yimou that showcases all of the best qualities of wuxia genre, while also balancing the more unnatural elements with a deeply human story that is relatable for all."" ]";0;0;0;0;1;0

The costume design was brilliant and felt very time appropriate for the period it was set in.  I loved some of the shots from this one. Really some beautiful gems that knocked me on my ass here, including one particularly ravishing shot of Knightley standing on the edge of a cliff. Great, great stuff there. On top of that, it was really well adapted from Jane Austen's novel, which I have never read, but have obviously heard quite a bit about. For a romance film, I did not find it necessarily romantic (though it certainly is), rather it works quite well as a period piece from the late 18th century, which is enough for me. Thanks to great acting, strong direction, good writing, and some really gorgeous shots, Joe Wright's Pride & Prejudice is a winner."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0
born-on-the-fourth-of-july;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;Jun 10, 2017;"[ ""Most war films are focused upon the horror of war as it is experienced in the battlefield. The accidental killing of civilians, friendly fire, and the terror facing the enemy are all well-trodden territory and Oliver Stone's Born on the Fourth of July portrays them through the eye of Ron Kovic (Tom Cruise). However, what separates this film from other war pictures is that it quickly moves away from those horrors. As hinted in the film's nostalgic and sentimental 1950s America first act, this is not a film about the carnage of war as it relates to the carnage itself. Rather, it is a film about what that carnage does to a person's mind, their body, and their spirit. How one encounter with the enemy can damage them for the rest of their life and alienate them from the world that one embraced them so eagerly. Born on the Fourth of July is a film about the things that many wish to overlook as being facts of war and the fact of fighting on behalf of one's country. This is a film about the dirty details that are inconvenient regardless of the side you are on."", ""Ron Kovic, a real man who wrote the book upon which the film is based, is a paraplegic from the chest down. Unable to walk or have sex, he feels like he is not a man anymore. Worse, he killed one of his own men in Vietnam and was partially responsible for the death of babies while there. In the hospital, he is greatly mistreated with nurses fighting him, threatening him with amputation, and telling him his sacrifice was worthless. Doctors never see him, all because they are overloaded due to demand with no budget whatsoever. At home, he is alienated from his family as they struggle to adjust to his paralysis and as he struggles to acclimate back into life at home. Drowning his sorrows in alcohol and prostitutes while feeling ostracized from anti-war protesters who hate what he represents and pro-war folks who hate that he is a reminder of the human cost of war, Ron Kovic is a truly tragic figure throughout the entire film. His tale is a moving and powerful one that calls to attention the one element we always forget: our veterans."", ""As an anti-war person myself, it is easy to see why veterans in America have been forgotten. As Ron figures out, nobody wants him. Too often anti-war protests turn against those who fought instead of focusing on the true source of evil: the government that corrupted those boys and girls minds and convinced them that this was worth their life. On the other side, the pro-war folks ignore the veterans equally as much as they are a reminder of the fact that war kills, maims, and damages completely. Politically, this winds up being the democrats who do not support veterans out of fear of seeing too pro-war to their base and republicans who do not support veterans because, well, they should be able to pay their own way and not rely on handouts (in essence, passing the buck so they do not need to think about them). The only ones who get hurt by this are veterans. It is tragic to see this film come out in 1989 and, yet, we are still here in 2017 wondering why the VA is awful and why we let so many veterans become homeless and unemployed."", ""In portraying this character, Cruise approaches it with great sensitivity. Perhaps, his turn as Ron Kovic is the most nuanced performance he has given in his career. Deftly portraying him as an unquestioned patriot before the war to a man who slowly realizes he was fed lies all these years, Cruise's depiction is heart breaking and entirely moving. Alongside him, however, both Raymond J. Barry and Caroline Kava give terrific performances as his parents. Both lost and confused about how to handle their son after the war, the two try their best. Eli (Barry) acts like a father and builds Ron everything he needs. He tries to essentially rebuild his son, which he knows to be futile, but he tries anyways. Patricia (Kava) struggles more openly, especially when Ron's anger and PTSD gets into full swing and he lashes out at everybody around him. For her, her son died in Vietnam and the man that came back in his place is a cruel and mean impostor. It is a nearly impossible mental hurdle to overcome and Kava's raw performance embodies just how challenging it is to see somebody you love be so impacted by something you wish you could fix immediately for them."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

The film is just as odd and truly all over the place as I imagine his films were and it just feels right. The film can feel a bit distant, but that said, it does paint a good picture of Wood and is incredibly sympathetic towards his delusion and while it is a comedy at times, the film can be pure drama and tragedy as you watch him fail. Ed Wood is a very funny film at times with some seriously laugh out loud moments and the film does a good job balancing this with drama and Wood's story. Johnny Depp also just happens to be brilliant as Wood, both in light and dark moments. Overall, Tim Burton's weirdo biopic on this weirdo man is a gem."" ]";0;1;0;1;0;0

Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are yet again fantastic in this film with their chemistry together on display for all to see. The two of them seem to just bounce off of one another and it gives the love between them a realistic feeling. Featuring the same hilarious moments, honest and riveting dialogue, and pure romance, as the first film, the thing that puts Before Sunset above Before Sunrise for me is the way in which the characters have grown. In the first film, they are innocent. They are both romantics who may not be open about this due to parts of their past, but deep down, they believe in love and \""the one\"". Now, both are jaded and unhappy. Yet, though they claim otherwise, both are still romantics. They are simply both afraid to be hurt further and show the scars of love lost. There is a longing between both of them that has left both unsatisfied in other endeavors. Their dialogue suggests they are now both cynics who no longer believe in love, but in reality, it portrays them as people who deny their true feelings because they are afraid of it falling apart all over again. For this, Before Sunset shows great maturity amid its romance that leaves hope for the future, yet that hope is tempered and covered in doubt. What will happen? Will they find happiness? A brilliant film, Before Sunset shows Richard Linklater's talent as a writer and director for all to see."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

The difficulty of joint custody and the separation of one's parents is represented here on two very different children. Also interesting is the division between \""intellectuals\"" and \""philistines\"" and their characterization in the film. In many regards, the former are portrayed quite negatively, even being shown as frauds. The latter, though certainly shown derision from the protagonists of the film, are not shown nearly any animosity in their characterization.

Luckily, Sellers plays three roles so we get to see a lot of him and he really helped put this one over the top for me. It is amazing to me that this one is still a riot considering that it was released 50 years ago, but it goes to show that good films transcend time and this one fits the bill completely. In addition to being funny, it is a great political thriller as we watch everything unfold in the film.

Lindsay Lohan is also great and this should have been a star-making turn for her and watching this makes me sad thinking of all the lost potential for her.

Packed to the brim with his trademark body horror, this one is quite a ride."", """", ""As with his later exercises in eXistenZ, Videodrome showcases oddly solid special effects that seem so real that you could reach out and touch the torso vagina bursting out of Max Renn (James Woods). Many Cronenberg films have these oddly realistic looking body horror sequences that never seem comical, but downright horrifying. The Fly had a lot of these elements as well and it really demonstrates Cronenberg's wheelhouse. He knows body horror better than anybody and he is not afraid to showcase his skill in this arena. In spite of his manipulation of the reality around us and within his typically realistic settings, the films always feel so horrifically real. Though exaggerations of the world around us, films such as Videodrome often mirror seedy elements of our world and bring them to us in a thoroughly visceral manner. While things such as those depicted in this film would not happen, some form of them certainly does (namely cults, non-literal mind control, snuff films, and the \""subterrainian market\""). Cronenberg has a knack for bringing these elements to the forefront of our mind and is truly horrifying."", """", ""The film's usage of alternate realities is also splendid as, once the concept is introduced, you can never truly be sure what is a hallucination. Hell, everything could be. Is there even a show called Videodrome or is Max Renn just psychotic? How much of this happened? Did he ever actually meet Nicki Brand (Debbie Harry) and others? There are so many possibilities and this is a prime example of how Cronenberg can mess with your mind. He not only distorts reality through his realistic settings and people juxtaposed against his body horror and unique special effects, but also through alternate timelines. Things that seem so real to Max appear to have been nothing but another hallucination. However, things can certainly go in the reverse and things that appear to be hallucinations could easily be reality. Things he imagined he hallucinated could have truly happened and the hallucination merely convinces him they did not. Weird, I know."", """", ""Cronenberg's toying with killing in the name of some movement or cult is another link one can draw to his later film eXistenZ (and I am sure others, that one just happens to be one I watched). In both films, characters kill people in the name of some movement. Here, Cronenberg makes it all the more horrifying by showing that everybody is playing for the same team and is truly being played, as we will soon all be under the control of \""Videodrome\"". This paranoia runs rampant throughout the film as one must one is Cronenberg keeps himself up at night wondering if he is under the control of some mysterious cult that is just waiting for the right moment to use him to further their goals. Poor guy. As it stands, he certainly has me paranoid after watching Videodrome. This film is dripping with paranoia in every shot, especially due to the acting of James Woods. An incredibly natural, everyman type actor (in spite of his clearly negative characterization, he seems relatively normal), his persona really brings a further level of horror to Videodrome. The paranoia he experiences and the violence he is forced to undergo feels so close to us, which makes it all the creepier."", """", ""As a whole, Videodrome is a very good body horror film from the master of the subgenre. Gleefully messing with our mind and our concepts of what can and cannot be real in the world and in film, this one showcases all that Cronenberg does well as a director. With significant paranoia, fear, and confusion in every sequence, you simply never know where everyone stands and what is actually occurring, which truly adds to the horror of it all."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0
suspicion;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;Jan 30, 2017;"[ ""Honestly, three-quarters into this movie, I had conceded that this one may just be a solid misfire from Alfred Hitchcock. It had suspense, but seemed to be taking too long to get to the point. Yes, Johnnie (Cary Grant) was creepy and a liar, but I needed a pay-off. My mind began to wander and it seemed like I had finally found a Hitchcock film that had missed the mark. However, even in this mixed state of mind, the film was admittedly incredibly suspenseful and filled with tension as you began to wonder, along with Lina (Joan Fontaine), if her husband Johnnie was really a dastardly murderer. What won me over was the third act. It is brilliant. Visceral, edge-of-your-seat entertainment, the third act must rank among the very best final acts of a film in Hitchcock's career. That said, in hindsight, the first and second acts are also often terrific in setting up the clues to the \""case\"" and hinting at the truth."", ""Deceitful and untrustworthy, Johnnie falls quickly into love with the rich Lina. Unbeknownst to Lina, Johnnie is a gambler, heavily in debt, and broke. Hitchcock immediately sets up the film to make Lina and the audience suspicious, especially after her father dies and Johnnie loses his job for stealing, but fails to tell Lina. He is no good and a thief, but is he a murderer? Lina seems unsure, but her paranoia and suspicion continue to spiral out of control. As a result, though it was lost on me initially, the audience's instincts also spike out of control. Every clue, every move, every action is draped in tension in the final act of the film. Sick from nerves, Lina is bed ridden. Johnnie bringing her milk, after learning of an undetectable and pain free poison found in every home, is filled with suspense. Hitchcock is the \""master of suspense\"" for good reason and he shows it here in this film. As she looks at the glass after Johnnie put it down, it makes the audience want to get up and scream, \""Do not touch that milk, it is poisoned!\"" When films make the audience feel such emotions, you can always tell just how effective its thrills and suspense are."", ""Cary Grant truly lives up to the billing as well, as his every move and look instills trepidation and fear. He seems like a snake and acts like one throughout the film. When he tries to convince Lina that he loves her and would never hurt her, it never feels genuine. It is almost as if he is convincing himself as well as his wife. His slimy, grimy, and despicable behavior leads to the belief that he is untrustworthy and, even worse, his lack of wealth and seedy nature easily instills the belief that he would kill Lina to get her money. As such, the film is filled with dread and suspense as we wait to see the lengths that he will go to in order to get out of the financial hole. As his wife, Joan Fontaine is terrific. She defines paranoia and fear as she quickly puts together the pieces of the puzzle that merely reinforce her mistrust of her husband. From dead friends, lies, cover-ups, theft, and more, her evidence is piling up. Fontaine perfectly captures this petrified wife character who solemnly realizes that she does not know her husband as well as she thought, as she has no idea if he could kill her."", ""The terrific final act is truly the cherry on top of this film, however. While the first and second acts are a mix of portions that do not work and Hitchcock firing on all cylinders, the final act truly saves it all. As they drive on an open road by a cliff, the tension and suspense of the moment is honestly overwhelming and leaves you clutching the seat to see what will happen next. It is here where the film's billing as a psychological thriller really pays off as the mental build-up in conjunction with that finale is incredible. This is a film that really messes with your mind and is honestly inconclusive. Though the ending seems to paint one picture, an argument for the exact opposite could be equally true. Johnnie is not a man who is easy to pin down, so his true nature is eternally elusive, so whether he is capable of truly killing or not."", ""Laced with tension and suspense, Suspicion is a tremendous earlier work in Hitchcock's filmography. While its first and second act are not as effective in the moment, they become great thanks to a phenomenal finale that leaves you guessing. As is typical, constant references to murder and the word itself are littered throughout and it is always compelling to see how Hitchcock keeps you wondering even if it is so apparent that murder plays a key role in this story.

dawn-of-the-dead-1979;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;Oct  8, 2017;"[ ""Masking social commentary and satire under hundreds of pounds of splattered zombie brains and human intestines, George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead is one of those films shows smart cinema does not need to be boring. Brilliantly crafted and thought-out social commentary is always on display in Dawn of the Dead, but the film nonetheless boasts a similarly impeccably constructed and thought-out representation of the zombie subgenre. As both a satire and horror film, Dawn of the Dead hits the mark, delivering both a thrill-ride of entertaining encounters and enough ideas to really leave you thinking after it is all over. As the follow-up to Romero's brilliant, Night of the Living Dead, the film similarly advances the horror set fort in the original, further setting up sequels that will continue to demonstrate the mayhem that is unfurling in, at first, Pennsylvania and, eventually, the world."", ""As a piece of social commentary, Dawn of the Dead perfectly nails both the mindless consumer and thoughtless consumption of the American consumer. This brilliantly constructed critique is exemplified in the setting of the film: a mall. A beacon of capitalism that can be heard around the world, this large mall plays host to the protagonists and the zombies. As they fight off the zombies inside in order to establish the mall as a safe haven for themselves, the protagonists wonder why the zombies are coming, only for one of them to explain why. Deep in the subconscious of the zombies are memories of this mall and all they know is they have to go there, but they do not know why. Throughout the mall, there are advertisements for sales and there is even an announcement promising hard candy to whoever spend a certain amount. This showcase of mindless consumers and the carrots dangled in front of them to entice them to buy underscores the ideas behind Dawn of the Dead with much of this commentary playing nicely as somewhat funny satire."", ""Romero takes it even further, however, and uses that as a jumping off point to show mindless consumption, even from those facing the zombies. As they race through a store, Peter (Ken Foree) and Roger (David Emge) agree to grab whatever they might need. Thus, Peter grabs a television and a radio. While they do use it, it is likely that other items could have been more essential. The television later proves to be useless as there are no longer any broadcasts, which naturally aggravates the men in the room as they can no longer mindlessly watch television. Later, a group of bikers go through the same store and one of the members is chastised for trying to grab a television. Added together with the ideas regarding the mindless consumer, Romero shows the change of pace in Dawn of the Dead from Night of the Living Dead. In 'Night', as theorist Richard Dyer argued, the white people are often depicted as lifeless. All of the zombies are white, while one white woman who is not a zombie is catatonic. The protagonist there being a black man, who is meant to exemplify life. Here, Romero shows that, due to capitalism, it is no longer just the whites that are lifeless. Now, there are black and hispanic zombies in the bunch, who must similarly be killed by the black and white protagonists. What was once the plight of only whites has now advanced in the ten years between the two films with the entire human race now turned into mindless consumers who only know where to go to buy something, not what they want to buy."", ""Furthermore, Romero takes the race angle of 'Night' and updates it in 'Dawn' to show the true enemy in the film. Though the zombies are unrelenting and everywhere, they can be escaped without much fuss. A quick shot through the head and they are dealt with. The only become truly problematic when they sneak up on you or there is a gang of them. The same cannot be said for humanity. A human with a mind to commit crimes or express aggression can hardly be stopped as easily. Showcased through a SWAT officer with a hatred of Puerto Ricans and blacks who bursts into a building just to kill some or the bikers who come into the mall and cause more mayhem than the zombies, Romero showcases how it is humanity who is humanity's greatest enemy and predator. The zombies may be mindless, but at least they are equal opportunity and killing solely for necessity. Humans kill one another for any reason under the sun, whether it be hatred, accident, or - in the case of the bikers in the mall - for territory. Unlike zombies, the large armies of humans who stomp in to cause mayhem in a region are hardly as easily defeated unless you are willing to stand your ground and fight back."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

Thoroughly evil, deceitful, and menacing, Pacino exudes evil here and plays the role perfectly, enticing the audience to both trust and fear him in unison as he wraps Reeves around his finger.

There was much criticism thrown towards the Ewoks, but I loved them. Not only are they adorable, but they were good characters. In addition, the showdown between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker, as well as that between the Emperor and Skywalker was riveting and really well done. The characters in this one continue to show incredible depth and really feel as though they are authentic humans. While Empire Strikes Back is also a very good film, the sufferings of being the middle film held it back from greatness. That problem does not exist in Return of the Jedi as not only does it end quite satisfactorily, but it does so after two hours of pure adrenaline and enjoyment.

cold-mountain;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;Nov  2, 2016;"[ ""A beautifully sweeping epic, Cold Mountain is a true accomplishment from director Anthony Minghella. In watching this, it becomes all the more tragic that he died about eight years ago with Cold Mountain being one of his final directorial works. At least, in his wake, we are still able to cherish this visual beauty. However, the brilliance of Cold Mountain is not just skin deep, as its epic sweep all encompasses a tremendous romance amidst the Civil War and, in this, the film also discusses the impact of the war on the South and the loss suffered by those at home. Plus, though not strictly a war film (it is, but it is not the film's main focus), Cold Mountain also offers brilliant battle sequences to go along with every other positive offered by the film."", """", ""Cold Mountain is a film some have compared to Homer's the Odyssey in structure. This is certainly fair as the film tells the story of W.P. Inman (Jude Law) and his journey to return home to Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman) during the Civil War. Suffering injuries, escaping those who will capture deserters, and crossing paths with a collection of individuals, Inman's journey is long and arduous. Among the tremendous cast that cross paths with Inman and Ada include Renee Zellweger, Eileen Atkins, Kathy Baker, Brendan Gleeson, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Charlie Hunnam, Natalie Portman, Giovanni Ribisi, Donald Sutherland, Cillian Murphy, Jack White, Ray Winstone, Taryn Manning, Emily Deschanel, and Jena Malone. Essentially, this cast is stacked. Every supporting character is played by somebody who eventually blew up, was a veteran actor, or was a relatively fresh face in acting. How they managed to get such a good cast together is mind blowing."", """", ""The film's main focus - the romance between Inman and Ada - is tremendously written by Minghella. Each line is precise and chosen well. The end result is a romance that, though the characters rarely share the screen with one another, is incredibly well-crafted and realistic. Though they barely know one another, their connection to one another is beautifully brought to life through the words of Minghella that breathes air into the lungs of the film. Even when things slow down (and they do slow down) and the film drags, the romance here keeps the film chugging along and taking on all challengers."", """", ""Visually, the film is stunning. From shots, such as Inman staggering to Ada alongside two towering snow-covered rocks, to the battle sequences, the cinematography of this film is terrific. The best part here is the framing, especially in that aforementioned shot. The result of shots such as this is a film that feels as poetic visually as it is verbally. Minghella clearly expended a lot of time focusing on his word choice in writing this film and it shows in the sweeping, verbose communication in the film. However, the visuals are the same way. The film's shots match its beauty step-for-step and often exceed it with a willingness to just slow things down and let the odd, romantic beauty of the war in the South soak in for the audience."", """", ""The battle sequences express this same beauty, especially the opening one when the Union bombs the Confederacy. The billowing tower of smoke and fire, as well as the ensuing battle that occurs in a cloud of dust and blood is pure eye candy. Minghella's camera lingers in this sequence quite often, offering a sort of juxtaposition between the beauty of the shot and the brutality of the war. Nobody was spared in battle and, as a result, nobody was spared at home. In this film, Minghella does not waste any violence. Though often brutal, his film is about bringing to light the suffering of those in war and those at home. Given that many war films focus solely on those in battle, this is a breathe of fresh air for the genre. In this goal, Cold Mountain is entirely successful, particularly in the sequence with Sara (Portman). A single mother with a baby who briefly takes in Inman on his journey home, she asks Inman to simply lay next to her in bed where she begins openly weeping. The specific pain and suffering experienced by those at home is obviously spoken about openly in the film, but never described verbally. Rather, it is always told visually with one slight written hints. This is one of the greatest accomplishments of the film, as it manages to delve in this often overlooked topic and offer great insight, without having to stand by and attempt to explain the pain. Instead, it makes it more realistic and intimate by simply showing it to you."", """", ""A brutal, beautiful, and truly sweeping epic, Anthony Minghella's Cold Mountain covers the Civil War like few films before it had. Covering battle, romance, and the life of those in South, the film plays no favorites, shows the good and bad of both sides, and covers its topics with grace and ease."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

Personally, I loved it. Though brutal, the film showcases Mel Gibson brilliantly using extreme violence to provide visual evidence of pain and suffering that sin brings. The prolonged scenes of torture were obviously a little much, but further exemplified this suffering and the price Christ paid for us to have salvation. Where The Passion of the Christ overcomes this extreme violence is in its portrayal of Jesus. Easily the best portrayal of Jesus that I have ever seen, Jim Caviezel was brilliant. The dialogue for Christ was on point, as was Caviezel's delivery and, to me, mannerisms. I was frequently almost moved to tears as I watched Caviezel's Jesus truly exemplify what I believe Jesus to be. Additionally, though she had no dialogue, Rosalinda Celentano was brilliant. A menacing and evil presence, she captured the true visual essence of Satan and every time she was around, it sent chills down your spine.

In many ways, it shows how these three troubled boys are not unscathed by the things that have happened to them and how all of them have suffered and will suffer profound losses that consume them entirely. I think the script by Brian Helgeland was fantastic and the direction from Clint Eastwood was really good as well. However, the real star is Sean Penn. I thought Tim Robbins and Kevin Bacon were pretty good in their roles here, but Sean Penn stole the entire show. His performance was absolutely marvelous and he really drew you into him, which makes his role in the film all the more believable.

In terms of acting, Viggo Mortensen is great, as are Ed Harris and Maria Bello. The only actor whose performance was iffy was Ashton Holmes as Mortensen's son. He struggles at times, especially when on screen with heavyweights like Mortensen and Harris. In addition, the film is filled with tension. The film may be a slow burner and all, but once it kicks into high gear, things are very interesting thanks to these very well developed characters and their interpersonal relationships. While at the end of the day, this is a movie, everything felt very authentic and you really believed these people were who they said they were thanks to great writing, acting, and direction.

For all of the films obvious shortcomings across the board, it is an incredibly well made and well crafted action film that sets the stakes, sticks to its rules, and comes up with unique and compelling ways to overcome the problems it puts before its heroes. Additionally, the creature design here is very nice and well done. Though it is dated in some spots, the aliens still look pretty cool. Heck, there is even some solid horror-esque moments here reminiscent of Alien combined with great references to Close Encounters of the Third Kind, 2001: A Space Odyssey, ET, and a few more that I am blanking on. Above all, Independence Day is simply entertaining. While that is often not enough to get the job done for me, it is here.

Considering themes of motherhood and identity, 3 Women is a deeply philosophical film that borders on incomprehensible plot-wise. Director Robert Altman may be known for plotless films, but this work is more akin to one by Jean-Luc Godard with the general resentment it has for those who try to follow a plot. Whenever it seems as though the film is able to settle in and begin being a truly cohesive work, it takes a dramatic turn and becomes a wholly different experience. In many ways, this film about three women is three films trapped inside of one body, which makes some odd thematic sense."", ""Conceived in a dream by Altman, 3 Women's psychedelic imagery is hardly its only indicator that it was once a dream. Its general elusiveness and the fashion in which its images escape the mind with equal parts subtle tranquility and frustration, 3 Women is a film that defies definition. Introducing us to Millie (Shelley Duvall) and Pinkie (Sissy Spacek), the film begins with them both working at a rehab clinic for geriatric patients. Pinkie is new so Millie is tasked with showing her the ropes. Soon, they become roommates after Millie's roommate moves in with her boyfriend. Pinkie's odd obsession with Millie is immediate. When Millie misses one day of work, Pinkie asks every other nurse at the clinic about her and keeps repeating that she found her to be incredibly nice. Yet, it is clear nobody agrees. Millie has people she hangs around with, but no friends. She sleeps with men, but that is mostly just because she will, not because the men want to sleep with her specifically. In this opening third of the film, Millie shown to be disliked by most and gratingly annoying to the point that nobody listens to her. Simultaneously, she blames Pinkie for all of her flaws. When her old roommate and some guys cancel plans with Millie (which they had thought was \""just drinks\"", while Millie thought it was a \""dinner party\""), she blames Pinkie for this. This section of the film sets the ground work for many themes to be developed later on in the film. Firstly, the concept of identity. Pinkie and Millie are both named Mildred, but Pinkie hates the name. At work, Pinkie accidentally punches Millie's time card. After staining one of her clothes, Pinkie just takes one of Millie's shirts. This manifests itself by the end of the film where it is shown that Pinkie had used Millie's social security number on her W-4 at work. The two of them have practically become the twin co-workers they have by this point. The two are linked and not just in their names. The two have reached the point where Millie speaks on Pinkie's behalf at work and where a man such as Edgar (Robert Fortier) wants to sleep with both of them. They are a package deal and two-of-a-kind, unable to be separated."", ""Yet, after Pinkie takes a nosedive off the balcony into the pool, the film shows identity in a different fashion. Not recognizing her parents (who are the weirdest people ever and about 105 years old, compared to Spacek who looks like she just hit 12), Pinkie goes on to want to be called Millie and embracing her name of Mildred. Earlier, Millie (original Millie) had similarly expressed issues with her parents by saying that she had a dream where her mother had brought her tomatoes, which she hates. Ironically, Pinkie also says she hates tomatoes. Regardless, the two flip after Pinkie's accident. Instead of Millie treating Pinkie poorly, the opposite is now true. Pinkie is even celebrated and beloved by the other members of the apartment complex. She is a real star in the place compared to Millie who is still ignored. Edgar, who first wanted to sleep with Millie, is now sleeping with Pinkie. Their worlds have flipped and the two are at complete odds with one another. Not having the best relationships with their mothers - a major theme that would be more realized in the third act - the two begin to show how identity changes rapidly. Millie is largely the same, but far more sheepish. She takes one stand at work, but bends over backwards for Pinkie despite the abuse. She acts like a mother rejected by her annoying bubblegum-popping teenager. Pinkie's u-turn in the aftermath of her concussion and amnesia begins to reflect the fractured nature of her mind and the film as a whole. Before transitioning into an out-of-left-field conclusion, the film shows Pinkie lying in bed with psychedelic imagery playing over her. Representing the dream-like nature of the whole film, it also hints at the way in which things blend and change at a shocking rate to the point that what once was is hardly incomprehensible and what is now is the only thing that makes sense."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

Their writing is so strong that their pain becomes your pain as the film invokes a consistent feeling of empathy for all three of the characters, regardless of their transgressions and personal faults. 21 Grams is a stunning work that will leave you in ruins."" ]";0;0;0;0;1;0

In the sure hands of Richard Linklater, the film manages to avoid being too formulaic and is incredibly funny throughout. The film manages to not just be funny, however.

Well-written and directed by Linklater, School of Rock also has a good performance from Joan Cusack and very impressive performances from the young kids who show tons of potential in this film. The main drawback is that some of the scenes are really hard to watch due to how uncomfortably awkward they are, but hey, that's just me. Coming into this one, I had pretty low expectations in spite of Linklater and came away quite impressed while also being quite entertained. A comedy film with heart."" ]";1;1;1;0;0;0

Robert Duvall, Costner, Diego Luna, and Annette Bening, are all terrific and have great chemistry with one another. Open Range does a good job establishing its characters, their motivations, and setting the stage for its big shootout. The action sequence is well handled and well shot, never becoming disorienting or confusing. Its purpose is clear and the proceeding elements of the film are done in a way that leaves you rooting for the protagonists, as you should, though the chemistry between the actors definitely plays into this element. As with many westerns, the film is incredibly lush and gorgeous, taking full advantage of its open, pure, and idyllic setting. A properly epic, well paced, and enthralling film, Open Range is a modern western with classical feel."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

Dripping with sexual tension and energy, the film really reels you in and hits all the high notes a neo-noir film needs to hit. It is intriguing, sexual, and really takes you for a loop throughout as you watch the plot unfold and finally figure out what is going on. In regards to that, this one is very, very well-written. The plot is complex and dense, but not too complex and really keeps you guessing throughout. The characters are fleshed out and really are a case of some serious foreshadowing cluing you into what is happening. The direction from Lawrence Kasdan is great and the attention to detail paid to the lighting, shots, and entire mise en scene is insane. Honestly, Body Heat is a phenomenal film that may be a touch sexist (okay, really sexist), but that does not detract from the overall product, which is truly a brilliantly crafted neo-noir erotic thriller."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

But, I did not love them. Once Upon a Time in the West was even going the same way for me until halfway through. Until then, it was a good western, but one with far too many sequences of somebody just staring off into the distance and then looking back, only to look off into the desert again. By the halfway point though, something changed. It clicked. This staring became brilliant. The scenes of action well earned and brilliantly executed. It is a pitch perfect western and was the very embodiment of what the genre is and was capable of becoming. With a terrific score, great acting, and brilliant direction, Once Upon a Time in the West is a tremendous film."", ""A story concocted by Leone, Dario Argento, and Bernardo Bertolucci, will hardly ever turn out poorly and Once Upon a Time in the West shows why. Its story - a man and his family with a land settlement are killed by a ruthless man. His widow is left with the land, which is apparently quite valuable as the railroad is set to come through the acreage and her husband planned on building a town surrounding it, having already purchased the materials. It is the perfect settlement and the criminals of the wild west know the score. In its relatively simplistic plotting, the film is clearly influential on a variety of westerns, such as Robert Altman's McCabe & Mrs. Miller or Clint Eastwood's Pale Rider. Both revisionist westerns, the films show upstart towns with unexpected value. Altman's film shows a frontierman who marries a prostitute (just like in this film), who meets his demise after his town becomes the target of men who wish to control the whole area. Pale Rider has a similar set-up, but with gold under the settlement. A variety of westerns have had this set-up, but both of those feel cut from the same contemplative and methodically paced cloth as Leone's film."", ""Direction-wise, the film is pitch perfect. Terrific staging of each sequence, a largely tight plot, and beautiful imagery adorn this film. For a film so slow and long, it never bores. There is significant power in the random close-ups of the film and it is because of the direction of Leone. The film is engaging due to the varied approach to the gun battles and characterizations in the film, with each sequence having characters hiding in signs or shadows, creating a great sense of mystery and originality each time a man brandishes a gun. Additionally, each character wears their personality on their sleeve. Every drop of this film is precise and included for a reason, even if the film is not dealing with overly complex themes or anything. It is simply a tight, straight forward western that hums along at its own pace. One of the strongest parts of this film, however, is the score from Ennio Morricone. At a certain point, the men all look the same. They are tanned white guys with beards. It is hard to tell them apart. Morricone's score helps. It serves as an introduction to who they are, what to expect from the scene, and it cultivates atmosphere. Numerous scenes ride on the sense of mystery instilled by Morricone's score that keeps the viewer alert to the fact that something is off or that something is about to happen. The score not only serves for dramatic impact and as an extension of the characterization, but it is also quite sonically pleasing with Morricone's classic western chords coming to play throughout the film and really creating the perfect ambiance for this film. There is not a note that goes wrong with every chord and line coming off beautifully and helping to created a full figured beauty of a film."", ""A classic and masterpiece, Once Upon a Time in the West is a film that I should have seen long ago, but I am glad to have encountered it now because I was finally ready to let Leone into my life as the master that he was. Brilliantly scored, directed, and paced, the film may be long, but its preciseness and terrific technical and visual elements sink their hooks into you with ease and never let go until the film ends. Of the 1960s westerns from Leone, this one certainly ranks as the strongest and with great reason. This is a film that soars on its unpredictability and originality, constantly keeping the audience guessing as to how everything will turn out due to both the plotting and staging of the film and its shootouts. This is not just some simple shoot 'em up western. This is a film with violence and shootouts that advance the plot and serve a purpose, which give them significant stakes and power. Once Upon a Time in the West is just so damn good."" ]";0;0;0;0;1;0
naked-lunch;9;Spangle;/user/Spangle;Feb  6, 2017;"[ ""With each passing David Cronenberg that I watch, I become convinced that my latest viewing in his filmography may just be the weirdest one yet. Naked Lunch may live up to this billing, at least until I watch another Cronenberg film. What billing is does live up to is that, as of now, it is my favorite film of his. Surreal, dark, and defying interpretation, Naked Lunch is a nut that is not just tough to crack, but it fights back. It is a film that, naively, I believed I had pinned down as we neared the ending. However, the one thing the film left me with, above all else, is to exterminate rational thought. To approach this one rationally is to approach it wrong. It is not a rational film, just as the world around us is highly irrational. It is the job of the writer to capture this irrationality and put it on display, as William Burroughs has so brilliantly done in his semi-autobiographical Naked Lunch."", ""After killing his wife accidentally via \""William Tell\"" trick, William Lee (Peter Weller) begins subconsciously writing a novel at the same time he gets caught up in world of governmental secrets exposed to him by his typewriter, which transforms into a bug. This is brought to his attention when he becomes addicted to a bug killing powder that, as his now deceased wife eloquently explained, \""Makes you feel like a bug.\"" Rationally, one could argue that the film is merely a result of his drug use. They are hallucinations, as William believes, that do not really exist. Yet, there is so much evidence that these things do exist that it causes cognitive dissonance. There is no way these things could be real, right? Well, it is a David Cronenberg film, so of course these things could be real."", ""Irrationally, the film makes a lot of sense and its purpose is quite clear. It is semi-autobiographical on the part of Burroughs, who has a drug addict, writer, and convicted of manslaughter for pulling a \""William Tell\"" trick and accidentally shooting his wife in the head. His novel, published in 1959, was incredibly controversial. Yet, in essence, the film is about writing and writers. The gateway to this alternate universe is the typewriter. From there, William receives his missions and, apparently, writes a stellar novel. Writers live in their own minds. To tell a story, one must delve deep within themselves and find a story worth telling that they could visualize. William's tale, therefore, is real. All of it. Every odd encounter is merely part of the writing process and the path his brain takes in order to spit out this novel of his. These visualizations and alternate reality are merely the high given to him by writing and living on the literary edge. Thus, he is addicted to writing and the high he receives from the written word. His world and the film itself is autobiographical of Burroughs beyond the similar life details. Rather, this is his world. Accentuated by drug use, Naked Lunch is the mind of a writer given to other writer's to let them know they are not crazy. Writing is a mad science to a degree and this film articulates the intricacies and oddities that the mind goes through when writing. In essence, writing is a drug that grants you a passport to an alternate reality. Yet, it is a bug that refuses to be exterminated and an itch that simply must be scratched."", ""To expose his story, in Naked Lunch this is Interzone, a writer must go undercover. Yet, he can lose sight of himself and begin to believe in his own cover story. By doing this, he loses sight of reality and of who he actually is in the real world. The fake story, Interzone, is one that he merely experiences and delves into when he needs to write. William realizes that he is losing sight of reality in the film when he cries on the ground after saying goodbye to two friends, fearful that he will never see them again. This fear comes from the knowledge that he is losing sight of reality. The high and power given to him through storytelling is one that makes the real world feel like a poor imitation of the reality he has carved for himself by himself. This is why the writers here are obsessed with their typewriters. It is their needle. Their vial. The instrument used to make them feel real and enter reality once more. As such, it is addictive."", ""The film itself, while defying rational thought, it is also about the extermination of rational thought. Writing enters us into a world of fiction. It defies rational thought and can be surreal. It can depict reality according to the artist. This ties together two scenes in the film. One, the opening where William's two friends are speaking about writing. One argues that rewriting is a must, while the other says it is a sin because it betrays your original thoughts. William says then that all rational thought must be exterminated. Later, Tom Frost (Ian Holm) communicates to William without his lips. His lips say something else as his words talk to him about consciousness and the killing of his wife."" ]";0;0;0;0;1;0

It is hard to put my finger on what makes this series so great, but I think we get a taste of it at the end as even when this film, the final in the trilogy, ended I was left wanting more. Over three hours was simply not enough of Frodo, Sam, Aragorn, Gandalf, etc, for me, which is an amazing thing to say. As for the ending, it is great, though it does go on a tad too long for my liking and is not as great as the rest of the film, but it works and it is pretty satisfying.

A film about highlighting our similarities in the face of so many differences and animosities, Joyeux Noel is a beautiful film celebrating the kinship of humanity. Telling the real life story of the Christmas truces of 1914 in World War I, Joyeux Noel is a film with great scope, as it focuses on the French, British, and German soldiers in equal measure. With good cinematography, gorgeous music, and an infectious Christmas spirit, Joyeux Noel is an undeniably remarkable work by director Christian Carion."", ""Blending bloodshed with tears, Joyeux Noel's great breadth really both elevates and harms the film. By showcasing the stories of all three sides and their similarities and all of the elements that make them human, the film expertly creates sympathy on all sides. When the bureaucracy shows up to condemn the actions, both in a religious and war sense, it leaves the audience feeling angered. Yet, it does nothing to undo the brotherhood on display beforehand. From shots of the three troops in their own trenches to the three sides meeting in no man's land to celebrate Christmas, the film is well-served by treating all sides equally. There is no bad, only good. In juxtaposition to the words of their superiors, the soldiers at battle know the truth: there is more that unites us than divides. For this, Joyeux Noel is a phenomenal work that serves up a striking and moving message to humanity: drop your arms and join together, forgetting our petty differences, and unite under one umbrella. This message is not restricted to religion either, though it does heavily depict Catholicism. As shown, the Catholic Church rebuked the priest who conducted the Christmas mass for the soldiers. Thus, religion is like nationality. It is merely something that serves to divide us. It is only when we are truly human with no barriers - such as in joining together to celebrate Christmas or burying our dead - do we find unity with one another. However, all of this said, its breadth hurts it in the character development department. With so much going on, names get lost in the shuffle and stories blend together. While the stories are all moving and serve to further unite the characters, it feel all too much for two hours. That said, this is a nitpicky concern, given the power of the togetherness in the film. In fact, it could be argued that by giving little attention to character development, the film is aiming to create a sense of realism. Essentially, we know as much about these characters as they reveal to the opposing sides. By the end, this is numerous and reveals a lot about who they are. However, it is only very little information, but it information with great impact that drives home the point that these are humans with lives and wives who, for all intents and purposes, is the exact same as yourself. Thus, we do not really need more character development because it would create an affiliation for certain characters over others when we should instead feel attached to all of them. This is fair and, obviously, I do agree. However, in a longer film, delving further into some stories on each sides would have been a great addition."", ""However, nothing can match the chills of Anna Sorensen (Diane Kruger) or Private Nicolas Sprink (Benno Furmann) singing for the troops as all sides play the accompanying music. Moving, stirring, and entirely breathtaking to watch, these moments repeatedly gave me chills due to the way in which it truly captures the spirit of Christmas and why this season is the best of the year. One of the few times we all come together, Joyeux Noel is about coming together at all odds. Here, music and a love of God bring the characters together and, even if you hate music or do not believe in God, it is hard to deny the power of the film in these moments."", ""Though called sentimental by some (and it certainly is), Joyeux Noel is a breathtaking and beautiful work about Christmas and what the season truly means. A film about dropping your arms and differences in order to join one another in celebration of the season, Joyeux Noel is a gorgeous work that is wide in scope, but never loses sight of its main purpose: to bring joy."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

However, where this one truly excels is in its message. A warning about eugenics, Gattaca is not really a science fiction film or a thriller.

In terms of the science fiction, the futuristic elements and technologies are all really well done and developed, plus all are very interesting ideas that may seem implausible now, but could be fact in just a matter of time. The thriller element was also interesting, but since I do not want to spoil too much, I will not mention what I like about it, but it keeps you on edge as you try to see if the cops will figure everything out or not.

A vampire film about an unsuspecting man who discovers a device that will give him eternal life, Cronos is a film with considerable heart, but also a terrific atmosphere, special effects, and a knack for making you feel unsettled. Of his works that I have seen, del Toro makes horror-esque films and often dabbled on the outskirts of the horror genre. Cronos is the most horror of any of them, but it is not the type to leave you scared and afraid to turn off the lights. Instead, it is the type of horror film that lingers in the air and in the mind."", """", ""With a compelling premise and well thought out mythology behind this mysterious cronos device, Guillermo del Toro creates a sense of mystery that quickly turns into dread as you discover what secrets this device holds. Creating this stiff, atmospheric tension, del Toro's debut never produces outright scares, but it does create significant tension. As Jesus Gris (Federico Luppi) begins to explore the device and transform before our eyes, the film is incredibly tense and retains this sense of mystery, as the film's mythology and explanation of events is ever evolving as we learn alongside Jesus what this device is truly capable of. The unique backstory aside, however, the film does largely stick to typical vampire genre tropes when it comes to the daily life of a vampire. However, del Toro executes these tropes very well and makes them feel fresh and new, in large part thanks to the backstory."", """", ""In terms of the writing, it is typical del Toro fare. Smart and well crafted characters who are very well developed and relatable. Particularly, del Toro manages to wring significant pathos out of this film, particularly when it comes to the relationships between Jesus and his wife and his granddaughter. Truly moving, this is the human core to all of del Toro's fantastical films and, as he will later do to perfection in Pan's Labyrinth, he executes it flawlessly. This is not some hollow vampire film. Instead, it is one with a heart and soul, which is always appreciated."", """", ""The film's special effects are another one of its major strengths, namely when Jesus is becoming a vampire. The decaying flesh, the ripping of dead flesh, and the full transformation, are really impressive. This is make-up special effects at their very finest and given the film's release date, this work is thoroughly impressive. How they managed to make them look this believable and never silly is a true accomplishment."", """", ""Overall, Cronos is a terrific film that showcases the skill Guillermo del Toro already possessed at the time of his debut, as well as hinted at even better things for the director.

Some call this an astute political allegory, but if the only element of that is that scientific experimentation will eventually bite us in the ass and lead to the demise of us all, then it is hardly profound. Despite that, it is an undeniably smartly crafted sci-fi horror film. Really, the film has far more to say on the front that nobody can be trusted in times of danger, especially those entrusted to protect you.

The writing is smart and the direction from Barry Levinson is solid with the film having very good pacing and being quite coherent. While the film can get a bit outlandish at times, Wag the Dog's excesses are largely due to its insane premise and the real situations it satires throughout the film.

The science fiction elements are great and really thought provoking about what we consider to be insanity. In addition, Brad Pitt was absolutely fantastic. He killed his role here and really stole the show, not to say that Madeline Stowe or Bruce Willis were not good, because they were. This one certainly keeps you guessing until the end and really sinks its hooks deep into you and does not let go until the film is over. The only thing about this one is that I saw in some places that it is considered a satire, though I never really found it funny. Sure, Pitt's over the top performance is at times funny, but for the most part, that is about it. But, aside from that small confusion for me, Twelve Monkeys is a very good film that shows Terry Gilliam's mastery of the science fiction genre."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

Not nearly as weird as David Cronenberg's early work, Spider is a more reserved film with an hour and a half of Ralph Fiennes exclusively mumbling. He has a few lines, but mostly just mumbles those too. Thus, it was a hard film to pin down and truly wring enjoyment out of from beginning to end. However, the finale is what cements this as a brilliant work. Far more reserved and grounded than Cronenberg is known for, Spider is an exploration of the mind of a broken man. Why is he forced to live out his days in an asylum after being seemingly fine as a child? Well, Cronenberg gives you the unexpected answer in a finale that elevates the entire film into being a very good character study."", ""Mumbling, bumbling, and stumbling his way through the film, Dennis \""Spider\"" Cleg (Ralph Fiennes) is a broken man. In a halfway home after leaving the asylum, he relives part of his childhood in his mind. Living with a devoted mother, Mrs. Cleg (Miranda Richardson), he has an alcoholic father Bill (Gabriel Byrne). His mediocre life gets worse when he believes he sees his father begin to find another woman attractive. Soon, this turn into a full blown affair and possible murder. This shakes the very core of the boy and, whatever mental issues he had before, become exacerbated and truly take hold. The boy is traumatized by what transpires and it leaves him turning into his own mind and tying strings around his room like a spider web. The broken adult version of Dennis shows no signs of overcoming what he has seen, still visibly shaken and incredibly meek."", ""This character study of a man and an exploration of what troubles him so is incredibly sympathetic. Blocking out traumatic experiences and the horror it causes him when he realizes what really occurred in beautifully captured by Cronenberg. Fiennes never has a freak out, he just looks dead in the eyes and carries this look throughout. He just floats through life in a brilliantly reserved and sympathetic portrayal of this man. Cronenberg, for his part, makes the trauma real and authentic. Seen through the eyes of a boy, it is easy to see how things can be misunderstood and such traumatic incidences certainly leave him pushing the events out of his mind. The finale reveals the truth and is incredibly well handled and makes a lot of sense. In this way, the film becomes quite shocking due to the unexpected nature of the finale and how all of the pieces fit together. In many ways, the film is like a puzzle and Cronenberg hints at that throughout. After a glass window shatters, the asylum workers put together the window again to ensure all the broken pieces are there. The end result looks like a puzzle and a spider web. For Dennis, he also tries to put together a real puzzle, but gets incredibly frustrated and throws it across the room.  This is also symbolic for the viewer as the film takes some time to come together. The pieces do not fit perfectly and instead get caught up in the web spun by Cronenberg himself. It can be a frustrating and challenging experience as this is a reserved film that refuses to give way to dramatics. A character study that shows how we compartmentalize things and the damaging impact it can have on our psyche, Spider is a film that messes with your mind and thrills in equal measure. Yet, it is a film that does not feature kooky David Cronenberg. Rather, he avoids theatrics and shock, instead going for a slowly unwinding mental knot of confusion and trauma. For his part, Fiennes is brilliant, even if his lines are limited. He truly shows his range here as he plays a man mostly through just emoting and looks in his eyes. He is not forced into acting crazy or having breakdowns at any point. Rather, his pain is far more subtle and somberly portrayed. Spider is a film that explores mental illness with grace and class, refusing to turn the mentally ill into mere props for entertainment. Instead, it shows the horror that the mind can produce for those that suffer from any form of mental illness."" ]";1;1;1;0;0;0

An oddly romantic love letter to the escape Vietnam provided for some, The Quiet American is also incredibly romantic in a more traditional sense with a truly engaging look at relationships forged during such troubling times. The subtle direction from Phillip Noyce is fantastic as is the very good writing that does a great job crafting these characters. As for the acting, Michael Caine turns in an absolutely phenomenal performance. It honestly may be one of the best performances I have been blessed to see. Brendan Fraser does very good as well when faced with the impossible task of out-acting Caine. Overall, The Quiet American is a truly engaging film that is very nuanced and incredibly subtle.

My main criticism with him, as much as I do like him, is that he frequently seems to just play himself in many films. Here, however, he does anything but. Steven Soderbergh's direction is great and the visual effects here of space and of the planet Solaris are breathtakingly gorgeous and really something to marvel at. In that way and in terms of what it all means, reminds me a lot of 2001: A Space Odyssey. Very ambigious, confusing, slow, and beautiful, Solaris is really quite brilliant, though a tough nut to crack. Personally, I am still racking my brain over what everything in this one meant and trying to figure out what I am supposed to take away. Ultimately, however, I think this is an orange you can peel in many different ways, which makes it all the more intriguing. Personally, I think there are many plausible explanations, whether they be on reality (what is truly real?), love (and its everlasting nature), and death (where will we reunite, if we ever do? letting go or can you truly ever let go?). It raises many interesting questions and it may not have all the answers and is most certainly very flawed at times and leaves many unanswerable questions (unless \""I don't know\"" is an answer). However, in spite of that, I adored this one. I love films with ambiguity and ones that raise many questions that make it fun to discuss and this is a classic example of that. Now, I would never recommend it to anyone, because if I did, odds are they would come back and call me an idiot since this one is an acquired taste, but I loved it all the same."" ]";0;1;0;1;1;0

However, first and foremost worthy of praise is the special effects. How they do what they do is mesmerizing to me.

halloween-1978;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;Sep 22, 2016;"[ ""A chilling horror film from director John Carpenter, Halloween is not without its age spots (what else did you expect after 38 years?), but remains an effective thriller to this day that has influenced a genre ever since it was released. Though Carpenter heavily riffs off of Alfred Hitchcock's horror masterpiece Psycho, Halloween is scary in its own right, though it often uses the same skills Hitchcock demonstrated in Psycho to make Halloween enter the next level of scariness."", """", ""Okay, the acting is bad. I tried to lessen the hurt there, but it honestly was really bad. In saying that, however, I do not expect much in this regard. The point of the film is to scare you, not wow you with the prowess of that actors. That said, it was bad enough to mention."", """", ""On the positive column is practically everything else. Brilliantly utilizing sound in a fashion shown off by Hitchcock's Psycho, the film utilizes deeply unsettling sounds that honestly scare you on their own. Forget the visuals. The sound is scary enough on its own thanks to the film's use of sounds that not just alert you that something scary is about to happen, but have no chemistry whatsoever with your ears. When watching a film such as this, the score really sets the mood and boy does it ever accomplish this in Halloween."", """", ""As far as the characterization of Michael Myers goes, John Carpenter does a great job establishing the lore of Myers and telling rather than showing. Instead of showing us his time in the mental institution, it merely tells us what happened there, which ups the scariness and impact of the stories. In most films, this is a mortal sin. For horror films, it can be a brilliant tactic and Carpenter uses it perfectly. Thanks to the doctor's descriptions, we get a clear picture in our minds of what Myers is, what he looks like, and how he acts. This mental image is far scarier than anything Carpenter could have shown us."", """", ""Additionally, the film never rushes proceedings. It is more than happy to sit back and wait to build anticipation. Rather than having Michael run around killing everybody in sight, he bides his time and significantly ups the tension by building it and building it up. This anticipation completely boils over when things finally hit the fan and the tension is dialed up to 11. While cliched by today's time, the climax of this film was really the first of its kind (if I am not mistaken, Halloween was the first film to kill the antagonist only to bring him to life again). Plus, though it can be a bit silly at times thanks to it being done to death by 2016, Carpenter handles the reveals very well. With over the shoulder shots from Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis) to Michael's \""dead\"" body, the shot of him standing up becomes all the more terrifying. As a result, this is truly a film that defines the horror genre and the way in which we watch the movie, become terrified, and yell at the screen, \""BEHIND YOU\"". Halloween is ripe with these moments and really benefits from it."", """", ""Halloween is a tough film to watch nowadays. Though there is an ever present sense of dread, a killer score, and endless tension, the film has truly been copied on a daily basis since its release 38 years ago.  As a whole, Halloween is a thoroughly scary and entertaining affair from John Carpenter with unmistakable influence from Psycho and on later films. Interestingly, there is little-to-no gore in Halloween, yet films that will rip it off for years to come bathe everybody in blood. Odd. Also, did anybody notice the cheeky foreshadowing of Carpenter's future remake of The Thing?"" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

There are two scenes in particular that are so well written that man do they hit you. They just knocked me on my ass and left me trying to recover from what I had just seen.

One of my least favorite directors for the way he randomly interjects race into films that are not about race at all, he manages to largely keep his mouth shut in this one, though he did add some very useless elements of racism that just did absolutely nothing for the plot in classic Spike fashion. Now, luckily for him, the film has a very interesting plot and storyline that Lee does tell well, but the true reason why 25th Hour is so successful is the acting. Truly a great cast, Edward Norton, Barry Pepper, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Rosario Dawson, Brian Cox, and Anna Paquin, are all awesome in this one and truly carry it. Norton and Hoffman are two of my favorite actors of all-time, but yet I cannot help but feel as though Pepper kind of stole the show a little bit. He was just that good.

ran;10;Spangle;/user/Spangle;Dec  5, 2016;"[ ""Ran is a masterpiece. Personally, I do not give out perfect ratings often. Every few months, maybe more, a film comes along that stuns me so thoroughly that a rating that is not a perfect score feels like heresy. Ran is that kind of film. From the story to the score to the cinematography to the colors, the film is a lyrical and poetic masterpiece from director Akira Kurosawa. Based on King Lear, Ran depicts the transfer of power from an old Lord to his eldest son, only for him to be subjected to watching his three sons destroy all that he built. A film about chaos of the mind and the world, Ran develops themes of family, respect, honor, nihilism, and postmodernism. An epic of profound scope, delicately brought to life by Kurosawa, Ran  is a film that immediately becomes one of my personal favorites."", ""Depicting the fall of the House of Ichimonji (fake), Ran is an exercise in trusting and respecting those that you what is on their mind, rather than lie to your face but cover it in complimentary words. In this way, Great Lord Hidetora (Tatsuya Nakadai) is doomed to watch his lands fall to ruin after opting to trust those that to lie to him, if only because they bowed before him when they did it. Though the sons will be blamed for fracturing the family, in many ways, Hidetora fractured the family and the family was always doomed to fail. As he had three sons, the power struggle would have continued no matter when Hidetora died. In many ways, this could be described as Ran's way of showing that our actions do not mean anything (nihilism) and everything is pre-determined for us (free-will or lack thereof). This is even mentioned by one character who says to not blame the gods for what occurs because everything has already been determined. Thus, it can certainly be concluded that the Ichimonji were doomed from the start to fracture. However, by trusting his unfaithful sons over his most faithful son because he spoke his mind, Hidetora merely sped up the demise."", ""Additionally, Ran is an exercise in violence begetting violence. Towards the end, when Hidetora's life is one again struck with tragedy at the hands of his son's violence towards one another, he asks \""Is there no justice?\"" Though his pain is authentic and he is incredibly sympathetic, Hidetora losing his sons to war is justice in its purest form. Throughout the film, we see castles of lords killed by Hidetora. We are introduced to daughters that were witnesses to Hidetora slaughtering their families, only to then be married off to one of Hidetora's sons. For Hidetora to suffer as he made others suffer - by watching his family be destroyed - is justice and demonstrates that you \""reap what you sow\"" and \""violence begets violence\""."", ""Ran also heavily discusses chaos. In fact, its title translates to \""chaos\"". Yet, the chaos in the film is two-fold: of the mind and of the world. As he family falls apart, Hidetora goes mad. His mind is very literally chaos. Though he has moments of lucidity, his insanity destroys his mind and memory, causing him to forget what his sons look like and forgetting who a faithful servant was. All of these moments are painful to see, in particular with the servant. Faithful from the beginning, Kyoami (Shinnosuke Ikehata) is distraught to see his master forget who he is and the audience certainly feels his pain. The madness of Hidetora, however, is matched by the now war torn region he is surrounded by. With bloodshed, plots for power, and intrafamily conflicts, there is very little chaos and the film reflects this with long, drawn out battle sequences highlighting every element of brutality. Though chaos appears to happen quickly from the outside, it actually comes from very precise and small steps and Ran goes to great lengths to show the slow descent into chaos experienced by the House of Ichimonji. From plotting wives to power hungry siblings, the collapse is hardly a gradual one."", ""As with many Japanese films, Ran also delves into themes of family, respect, and loyalty. In particular, respect and loyalty are a large element of the film. With long scenes of men showcasing their loyalty by bowing or following their master into battle, Ran develops a constant theme of loyalty. Though some loyal men die, their loyalty is always celebrated, in particular when they do not stay quiet and instead speak their minds. Even if rebuked, they are proven to be right in the end and their original objections were proven to be justified. Had their warnings been headed, the collapse of the Ichimonj would not have happened. As such, Ran could be called a celebration of contrarians. Though they are unpopular figures, the words they speak come from the heart and should be heard clearly, in order to avoid making a fatal error."" ]";0;0;0;0;2;0

Edward Norton, Anthony Hopkins, and Harvey Keitel, are all very good, while Ralph Fiennes delivers an absolutely bone chilling performance as the \""Tooth Fairy\"". Philip Seymour Hoffman is also good in a supporting role. The direction from Brett Ratner is shockingly good. He did a great job creating scares and multiple scenes caused me to jump back a little bit, which is great. In addition, the script from Ted Tally is also very strong, not as good as the one who wrote for The Silence of the Lambs, but it worked very well. At times, this one can feel a bit like a police procedural, but all the same, I really did like this one and loved the way it ended as well (the very, very end). Some things could have been better, such as the beginning, and then some elements towards the end of the film that just felt cheesy, but all the same, Red Dragon is a good film that entertains in its two hours and is really well made."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

I loved it in the beginning, lost it in the middle, came back around towards the end, lost it again, but then the final sequence convinced me I did enjoy the film. Now, these moments are not attributable to general flaws in the film. Definitely imperfect and highly flawed, Femme Fatale is simply just a cold and unwelcoming film. It slinks along and is both slow and precise, which makes it a hard film to fully appreciate in a single viewing. Yet, what is not hard to appreciate is a great De Palma mystery thriller with solid performances that keeps you guessing until the very end."", ""The greatest flaw in Femme Fatale is also the biggest spoiler, but it comes towards the end and definitely changes the perspective of the film. Here, much of the film seems to come together initially, but then back pedals and turns on its heels. As I always this kind of twist, the same applies here to Femme Fatale, which is unfortunate in an otherwise low-key and mysterious film that it would rely upon such a silly moment. Fortunately, it does turn around and return to being this mysterious film. With small details, terrific direction of the actors in terms of placing them in the frame and on the set, the final sequence is the highlight of the film. Bar none. Featuring De Palma's flair with big set pieces, this one has a lot of moving parts that come together poetically and make this third act come off with cinematic brilliance."", ""Not really featuring many notable tracking shots (obviously they are there, but none that really caught my eye as many of De Palma's tracking shots do), the film does feature a lot of split-screen. The other really notable tenant of any De Palma film, the split-screen is used heavily in this film and to exquisite effect. The split between Nicolas Bardo (Antonio Banderas) and our femme fatale Laure (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos) as Bardo takes pictures of her while on his balcony is incredible. De Palma uses this twice to show Bardo on his balcony during the second act and then again towards the beginning of the third. Both are pure brilliance and just look phenomenal on the screen."", ""As for the plot, it is honestly convoluted and a lot of it seems incredibly fortunate/convenient (particularly events surrounding the \""seven years later\"" element), but the film is not set in the real world by any means. In a way, it is sort of fantastical, highlighted by the stilted and awkward dialogue and performances. Banderas and Romijn-Stamos hardly act human in this film. They seem almost robotic or alien. This could be attributed to bad acting, but it does feel entirely purposeful when considered in the context of the final twist that I may not have liked, but does make sense. There is a reason why this film unrealistic and almost dream-like throughout and the acting contributes to this feeling. Yet, the mystery element here is in large due to Romijn-Stamos' performance. Inherently mysterious, her character leaves Bardo and the audience completely in the dark throughout. De Palma does not offer a helping hand and forces his audience to put it together themselves as to what is occurring. By the end, things begin to come together, extraneous moments are enveloped in the rest of the plot, and the film begins to make sense. However, you must be willing to put it together because it is quite convoluted and, as I said, De Palma offers no assistance."", ""Thrilling, mysterious, and entirely unique, Femme Fatale is an engaging, hard to crack, and completely compelling work by Brian De Palma. As with much of his work, it is incredibly divisive, yet has been praised by certain critics (Ebert) and for good reason. De Palma knows how to make a movie and how to keep an audience on the edge of their seat throughout. Though cold and convoluted, Femme Fatale is a worthy film, but only if you are willing to provide the warmth and attention it needs to make sense."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

There is even a sequence at the end where Kieslowski opts to have the camera go out of focus as Julie and Olivier (Benoit Regent) work on finishing the concerto written by Julie's late husband Patrice. A beautiful sequence of indescribable melody, the film's music really encapsulates the sheer beauty and wonder of this film. I am no music expert, but to say that the music in this film is beautiful and meaningful would be a terrific understatement."", """", ""The cinematography is beautiful, but then again, I am a sucker for any significant use of color as is displayed in this film. Often signifying depression, sadness, or simply grief, blue is used to perfection in this film.

The way in which Kieslowski works in the color in seemingly mundane ways is brilliant and highlights the detailed and subtle nature of this masterpiece."", """", ""On that point, Three Colors: Blue is an incredibly detailed film that demands to be re-watched multiple times in order to not just pick-up on everything that Kieslowski is laying down, but to also try and come to some kind of determination as to what the film is telling you. For me, the story is about a woman grieving and learning how to deal with that grief. After initially destroying everything that meant something to her old life and liberating herself from that weight, she learns that the past cannot be escaped. Instead, by embracing her past and letting herself move past the pain, she will liberate herself from it. Rather than running, she can stand still and move past her immense grief.

my-big-fat-greek-wedding;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;Aug 27, 2017;"[ ""Playing out like a sitcom, complete with musical transitions between scenes, My Big Fat Greek Wedding is one of those unexpected box office smashes that became a bit of a cultural touchstone. Written by and starring Nia Vardalos as 30-year-old Greek virgin who is expected to find a nice Greek boy to marry and have kids, the film is an uproariously funny work with sharp wit and great cultural jokes about Toula's (Vardalos) painfully large and Greek family. With a wedding around the corner to American white boy Ian Miller (John Corbett), the Greek family behind Toula must grow to accept this non-Greek into the family over the course of the film's 90 minutes, all while celebrating their Greek heritage throughout. Though perhaps not a great piece of filmmaking, My Big Fat Greek Wedding shows that two things are true: real life is often funny enough on its own and writing what you know yields phenomenal results when done right."", ""As a comedy about a wedding and an obnoxious family, My Big Fat Greek Wedding is not exactly a deep work. There are some light themes that emerge, but they seem to just pop up out of the circumstances shown in the film, instead of any actual purposeful intent. For example, themes about assimilating into a culture you are unfamiliar with or having to accept the unfamiliar person into your world are both discussed at length due to Ian joining the family, but these are hardly major developments or revelations. Plus, as a comedy, this fish-out-of-water element is played more for comedy than any semblance of thematic nuance. That is not an issue, mind you, but this is certainly not a film with a lot of substance. Rather, it is one that exists purely to entertain and make you laugh, which makes it a tough film review to rate. At which point does one recognize there are faults in this film - the televisual feel that is pervasive in the film and the bad acting, namely - and still recognize that the film nailed all of its stated goals."", ""Personally, I prefer to head towards the latter when it comes to films such as this. Consistently funny, smarted scripted, and capable of making fun of a culture in the way that only those who are a part of that culture can, My Big Fat Greek Wedding is an absolutely hysterical film. It is one of those few films that nails jokes throughout with no sign of letting up. Often times, these joke-a-minute films start to lose steam at a certain point, but this never does by retaining the same wit throughout, as well as the correct running gags (Windex). As a romance film, the \""meet cute\"" moments are cliche to be sure, but still effective in putting a big, goofy smile on your face. It is a cheesy and sugary romance, but rings with authenticity and realism due to the problems faced by this cute couple in advancing their relationship to marriage. Never overstaying its welcome with the comedy or the romance, the short runtime allows the best moments of both to stay in with the film feeling rather stream-lined and focused, never straying into subplots or bloat that could have rendered it a far worse film."", ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding is a quintessential example of using the romantic comedy formula to your advantage with a funny, smart, and cheesily romantic work.

Off-the-wall and truly odd, 24 Hour Party People is both a compelling biopic of Tony Wilson, the man behind Factory Records, a film about the bands who he worked with, and a film about the Manchester music scene. Told in a news broadcast fashion thanks to Wilson's background as a reporter, the film frequently breaks the fourth wall to tell its tale and blends fact with fiction (while letting you know which is which along the way). Aside from the great music and the backgrounds behind it all, the film is a truly compelling drama that also tosses in some comedy that hits fairly often. Now, of course, this is a film that will not be for everyone. It is quite oddly told and its glorification of the era may rub some the wrong way, but as it stands, it is a truly vivacious and frenetic film that captures the drug-induced haze of the era, as well as its pure brilliance."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

Starring Will Ferrell in a career-best performance, Stranger Than Fiction also features good performances from a stellar cast that includes Maggie Gyllenhaal, Dustin Hoffman, Emma Thompson, and Queen Latifah. Together, they help to bring to life a unique premise with a very non-unique core that explores the age old question, \""What would you do if you knew you were about to die?\"" A very unique execution of this simple question, Stranger Than Fiction is an incredibly heartfelt film with a very human center that explores humanity and our greatest fear; death. With smart writing and good direction, Stranger Than Fiction quirkiness never gets out of hand and instead delivers on being a smart film that takes its characters seriously and though there is a certain lightness to the film, it can be incredibly dark as it explores death, fear, and the boundaries of our own world.

With a strong performance from Mel Gibson in the lead role, Signs is an incredibly well crafted science fiction thriller that does provide many answers, to the chagrin of many viewers, but I loved it. Plus, the emotional drama and personal trauma were both well handled and given the appropriate weight in the film. Together with the suspense, they combined to make a well told and truly engaging film. Additionally, the direction from Shyamalan is very good. Not only is it tense, but it is well paced and well told. He knows how to create suspense and thrills and does it here with incredible ease. Nowadays, it is sad to look back on a great film like Signs and think of what could have been with Shyamalan, but nonetheless, it is a very good science fiction film that proved thoroughly chilling."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0
volver;9;Spangle;/user/Spangle;Jan  6, 2017;"[ ""Starring a crazy, but close and fractured Spanish family, this one hit me pretty good. Though my family is not Spanish (Costa Rican, so they do speak the language), this film explores sexual abuse, death, and loneliness. Though my family does not have a history of sexual abuse (as far I know), the elements regarding the death of Irene (Carmen Maura) and her return to care for her sister and how she appears to her daughters to tie up loose ends, is entirely moving. On my Costa Rican side, the one I am far closer with, my mother and her seven sisters lost their mother back in the 1990s. I do not remember her, but they often speak of her, the food she made, and how she will often appear to them in dreams. As far as I know, she is not appearing to right any wrongs, but all the same, I can see the parallels. Similarly, most have had some rough histories with men from abuse, adultery, or pure laziness. Thus, the complaints regarding abuse (sexual in the film) and adultery by the women in this film also further hits home. All told, Volver was a film made for my enjoyment and Pedro Almodovar knocked it out of the park. My second film from him, this is a welcomed film after All About My Mother was good, but left me feeling cold. Volver is very much the opposite with brilliant direction, acting, and a heartfelt and thoroughly moving story."", ""Part magic realism, tragedy, and farce, Volver has a bit of an absurd plot at times, but can be boiled down to: a woman, Irene, comes to visit her two daughters, Raimunda (Penelope Cruz) and Soledad (Lola Duenas). Initially taking care of her dying sister (her daughter's aunt), Irene is here to make amends with Raimunda. Though she was always tight with Soledad, Raimunda had drifted away from her in her teens for reasons unknown to her. However, upon Irene's death, she learns why and shows up to make amends. Initially nervous to see her, Raimunda eventually finds out her mother is with Soledad anyways and what ensues is a phenomenal finale to the film. The final quarter of the film is the strongest section without question as it is the most emotional portion. In particular, the final line where Raimunda is excited to have her mother back and finally gets to talk to her, absolutely ruined me. Thinking of my mother and aunts when they merely get to see their mother in a dream, it was very easy for me to fall in love with this section of the film and the film as a whole."", ""This power of the mother-daughter relationship is the real strength of this film. While watching the scenes in the restaurant between Raimunda and the film crew, I was confused as to how it played into the film as a whole. Obviously, there is great comedy as there is someone hidden in the freezer in the back, but her success and camaraderie with the crew does not add much. That is, of course, until she decides to sing. In the scene with the musicians on the crew and her singing a song that her mother taught her, while her mother is hiding from her in a car, is incredible. Moving, emotional, and powerful, the emotion is clear on both the faces of Cruz and Maura. They really nail this scene and make it one of the most powerful definitions of the relationship between two. Even more, the song itself is about the memories and pain a person carries with them at night that keeps them awake. The connection to the plot and hidden pasts of the characters is clear, which makes the song a tremendous selection and the scene as a whole becomes truly wondrous."", ""In full transparency, I always love films about death. I am probably weird, but they are always so moving and powerful. Volver is no exception and underscores why good films about the subject work so well. The film underscores the feelings of loneliness, grieving, and healing, people go through. The film also really underscores the beauty of life, in spite of pain, and the beauty of death, in spite of the reason. Death is not be feared, but here, it shows this odd beauty as well as the darkness it can create, or turns it into comedy. This may seem odd, but it does work quite well for Volver and Almodovar assures that the moments are given their due weight."", ""After not loving my first entry in his filmography, Volver made me understand the love for Pedro Almodovar. Moving, emotional, and powerful, Volver's great accomplishment is its mother-daughter relationship, the regret, death, and lost time. Thanks to terrific acting, directing, and writing, Volver really hits home at times and is a truly tremendous experience. Though occasionally slow and a little bloated in spots, the finale and overall film make these flaws incredibly easy to look past."" ]";0;0;0;0;1;0
roman-holiday;9;Spangle;/user/Spangle;Apr  1, 2017;"[ ""Back when I reviewed La La Land, I discussed postmodernism. In particular, I discussed the concept of hyperreality. For many cities, such as Los Angeles and Paris in La La Land, the way in which they are perceived by many does not actually exist. These cities tend to be dream-like cities that people, over time, have romanticized heavily. Others can include Tokyo, Manhattan, Las Vegas, Miami, or maybe even London. These cities are ones where people have a concept of the city in their mind, but when they arrive, they realize the city of their dreams is not located there. What they imagined was this hyperreality that, in fact, was never really there. Rome, where Roman Holiday is obviously set, also meets this measure with various films and individuals romanticizing Rome to the point that the city ceases to exist. It is no longer there and what stands in its place is nothing anybody recognizes as Rome. Given that this romantic comedy is set in Rome, there is a connection between the hyperreality of Rome and their day spent together."", ""In exploring the bounds of this dream world, Princess Ann (Audrey Hepburn) escapes from the embassy for a night out on the town. However, some sleeping medication ensures a night turns into a day when she is found by newsman Joe Bradley (Gregory Peck). Once he recognizes her, Joe hopes to score a good story out of his day with Ann, only to wind up falling for her instead. Together, the duo encounter the cops, drive mini-bikes, dance by the river, fight private security guards, and visit various tourist traps and memorials. Yet, their time together is fleeting. Ann must return to her country and duty as a princess. Joe wants to return to America. No matter how much both enjoy their time together in Rome, none of it really exists. Their relationship is one built on mutual deception and one that acts as a ticking time bomb. It must end and they must snap out of this dream world that is unlike any other experience in their life. Rome, for them, goes hand-in-hand with their dreamy day together and will, likewise, be imagined to be a far grander place than it really is under the surface of their dreams."", ""Director William Wyler and screenwriter Dalton Trumbo quickly separate their dreams from their realities with their demeanor and actions in both. For the latter, Ann sets out to do things she never gets to do. As her family and upbringing is quite conservative, she wants to let loose and have a day to herself. She cuts her hair, dances with strange men, and dresses down. She paints the town red and turns Rome into the canvas upon which her dreams have been painted and drawn out. Alongside her, Joe indulges in a dream for a better life, only to come to realize that this better life would include Ann. Through this day together, both indulge in their dream world that both know cannot and will not last long, but they make the most of their time together. In many ways, this is somewhat akin to a film along the lines of Brief Encounter or The Bridges of Madison County. Though both concern affairs, they also depict forbidden love that has a time limit. Roman Holiday has a far shorter time limit and is scandalous for different reasons, but is scandalous nonetheless."", ""In regards to their demeanor after the encounter, both are incredibly professional. They share nothing but looks with one another that imbue the passion they feel for one another akin to films such as Carol. Via nothing more than a look, the two show their passion and nostalgia for another, though both recognize that the relationship is not meant to last. Thus, there is no need to pretend otherwise. Furthermore, this finale that lacks a climactic romantic overture shows a direct influence on La La Land. Not only does that film often define itself by simple looks by its lovers, but it also tears them away from one another and leaves us waiting for Ann or Joe to go running after their love. Yet, that moment never comes and they go their separate ways. Naturally, Roman Holiday's finale is likely also influenced by Casablanca, as was La La Land's. Their relationship is not built to last and is best to remain in the dream world of Rome. Testing it out in a non-dream world would provide enough strain to tear them apart as they would feel their heart calling them away from that whom they love. This separation between dreams and reality is further established by the photos being returned to her and by Ann remaining tight-lipped to her servants. There is no record of what happened and nobody is speaking about anything. It will instead live on in their hearts and minds before it reaches the point where all parties begin to even wonder if it happened at all or if it were merely just a dream from a better world."" ]";0;0;0;0;1;0

Lots of things happening, though you do have to pay attention to pick up on them, but largely, this one is a character study of multiple different characters, which is a very interesting thing to see. This one is ultimately all about the script and the acting. David Mamet's script is brilliant and rife with brilliant dialogue and near perfect pacing. It feels as if we know every character by the end and everything they all say is pitch perfect. The acting from this star-studded cast of Al Pacino, Jack Lemmon, Alec Baldwin, Ed Harris, Kevin Spacey, Alan Arkin, and Jonathan Pryce, is predictably good. No one expected anything less and they delivered a complete home run. It is rare to see so many good actors sharing the screen together, so it is a real treat when they do.

army-of-shadows;9;Spangle;/user/Spangle;Aug 25, 2017;"[ ""On the surface, there is not a lot of satisfaction in watching Army of Shadows. Set in the 1942, the French resistance runs operations against the Nazis that either outright fail, fizzle out, are aborted, or are minor victories. There is no climax or crescendo to these depictions. There is no honeymoon period with director Jean-Pierre Melville leaving no time for those in the resistance to lick their wounds or reveal in victory, instead dumping them in the next situation. There is no telling what will come around the bend for those in the resistance, instead they are doomed figures restricted to hiding in the shadows and await their own demise, all while fighting for the future of a Nazi-less France. Powerful, solemn, tragic, and cold, Melville's Army of Shadows continues to find supporters due to its stirring depiction of men and women uniting to fight for their country with no expectation of success, reward, or glory. Instead, they do it because they must, if their children are to ever know freedom."", ""Criticized for glorifying Charles de Gaulle by French critics in 1969, Army of Shadows wound up getting forgotten and only received an American release in 2006. The odd part, of course, is that De Gaulle is in one scene and, if anything, the film does anything but glorify the resistance. They are the heroes of this tale, yes, but Melville is entirely honest about the resistance. These are not wholly good men or women. Their cause may be a valid and heroic one, but their means and willingness to kill those who inform on them certainly calls into question just how truly \""good\"" the members of the resistance are. Pitted against the Nazis, it is impossible to not root for the resistance, but Melville never shies away from those seedy elements that show the duality of evil on both sides of this conflict. Just because one side has a good cause does not mean all of the evil done in the name of the cause is entirely justified. While Melville himself had experience fighting with the resistance, even he recognize that the means used by the resistance were not always savory and worthy of praise, even if their cause was one in which he fully believed."", ""With cold, flat blues and grays adorning the film, it is impossible to not come away believing this to be a solemn and melancholy work. It thrills and keeps the viewer hooked, but beats you down with unrelenting bleakness. While these men and women lay their life on the line every day to free France from the Nazis, one thing is absolutely certain: they will all die. They are operating on a set clock that, at any moment, could end with them being caught and tortured. As a result, perhaps the only possible future for them that gives them any sense of relief or bliss is their ability to commit suicide via a cyanide capsule when they are caught. None of these characters live to see France liberated, nor do they expect to be able to see this event. Rather, they fight to advance that possibility and open the doors for others to finish what they have started. In many ways, their mission is just an elongated suicide mission. It is hopeless and it will kill them, but is more valuable to their country and fellow man than words could ever hope to describe."", ""Perhaps the most prevalent theme in the film is just how difficult it is to truly resist an oppressive government such as the Nazis. It is in this depiction that Army of Shadows reveals just how little it seeks to romanticize its heroes. Showing them murder people or escape capture just to put themselves in a position to have success on a mission, something inevitably goes wrong for this band of rebels. No matter what they do, no matter how perfectly thought out and executed, there is always some extenuating circumstance that necessitates their retreat or aborting of the mission. In large part, this is due to the overwhelming presence of the Gestapo. Like a band of stormy weather bearing down an unwilling city, it does not matter how prepared you because they will engulf you eventually. The resistance can hide in any number of shadows they want to, but the Nazis will always be right around the corner ready to arrest them, torture them, and let them wither away in a cell. It is the equivalent of standing in a room with the wall and ceiling closing in on you. There is no escape, but you sure as hell with try to fight against the wall before it crushes you."" ]";0;0;0;0;1;0

It is dark, yes, but it is deeply emotional and entirely tragic, yet beautiful all the same. From the shots of the lovely Irish countryside to the interactions amongst the characters to the costumes, the film was very much a beautiful one. However, it is the acting and characterization of the characters that really help to make this film a home run. In war films, there is typically a plethora of action with little-to-no character development. However, here, we get both. We are not shielded to the carnage of war as there is plenty of \""action\"", but we also get the emotional trauma that accompanies war in the characters' interactions with one another and their families. Cillian Murphy and cast also kill their roles and really handle this one perfectly, as does the director, Ken Loach. Another strength for the film is the delicacy with which is handles the tension between the British and the Irish. Yes, the British are depicted as evil and unjust, but we are not given a romanticized version of the IRA either. Instead, we see them doing exactly what the British do, but since we are seeing the war through their eyes, we are not angered by their actions. But, by showing them doing exactly what the Brits do, especially at the end, the film allows us to realize that there is no true bad guy and both sides have rotten elements to them. Nobody is truly innocent on either side. At the end of the day though, the violence and trauma depicted effect everybody involved in the war effort, whether directly or indirectly. A beautifully tragic film, The Wind That Shakes the Barley is a very good film. It is not a great one, but it is hard to ask for much more from a film of this kind."" ]";1;1;1;0;0;0

He was phenomenal, creepy and unsettling all wrapped into one and he nails the role. Director Christopher Nolan shows incredible talent here as he manages to creepy a truly unsettling atmosphere that never scares you to be sure, but certainly keeps you on edge. The script is very good and the characters are very well done, to the point that you are never truly sure who is good and who is truly bad.

With films that take some twists and turns that are pretty unexpected, the success of the story rests on whether these are expected or not. In this case, they most certainly were not to me, though I would love to watch this one again and try to pick up on those clues. Not horror in the typical sense, this one has a way to get into your mind and mess with it a little bit, but to me, this one is not horror. Sure, after watching it, you kind of feel as though you watched a horror film, but this one struck me as more of a thriller with some elements from horror.

From the moment he entered the picture, he began staking his claim as the actor with the best performance in this film. His performance honestly floored me and, while he clearly defined himself as the antagonist and pure evil, I could not help but root for him to some very small degree. Beyond the acting, the action was really well done and, throughout, the suspense and intensity of those situations and the non-action sequences were definite pros for this film. The characterization of everybody was very well done as well. The film was just two hours, but managed to go into shocking detail on all of the major players and that really impressed me. Another pro was the sets, costumes, and cinematography. All of those worked really well to encapsulate the time period and the cinematography really provided some \""classic Western shots\"" that were as beautiful as always. I really have a thing for the cinematography in westerns and this one is a great example of that beauty.

Identified as the best Dutch film of all-time by the Dutch themselves, it is not hard to see why Verhoeven's film has become so praised. With his trademark sexual exploitation and neck spurting violence, Black Book is a thrilling and suspenseful WWII thriller that constantly defies expectations with its portrayal of betrayal and the improbable allies and enemies made by our hero. Set in the final day of Nazi occupation of Holland, the film is neither damning nor sympathetic to either side and Verhoeven finds a balance in the war, opting instead to tell the story of one incredible woman."", ""With Carice van Houten starring as Rachel Stein/Ellis de Vries, Black Book is already off to a good start as Van Houten turns in a characteristically terrific performance. Subdued, sensual, and manipulative, Van Houten is a perfect fit for the sexuality demanded by Verhoeven's lead characters. She also handles herself in the dramatic scenes incredibly well, being both emotionally available while never crying. You can see what she has seen and had happen to her has a deep emotional impact, but on the outside, she is a rock and ready to take on all comers. This power and strength is a positive trait of the character and one that Van Houten exemplifies at all times. Though the men in the film are obsessed with her breasts and she is constantly having them exposed, an act that would theoretically establish her as subservient to the men leering at her nude body, she retains power and control of the situations she finds herself in. Of course, men do rescue her in the film, but at all times, she is ten steps ahead of the men in the film and always capable of fighting back."", ""Interestingly, the film finds ethical people on both sides. Sent to become the girl of Captain Muntze (Sebastian Koch), Rachel/Ellis quickly discovers that he is a decent man who, in spite of his crimes he has committed, wants to see an end to the bloodshed. Though he should pay for his crimes, he is not as evil as other Nazi leaders and wants the war to end as soon as possible. He also truly loves Ellis and refuses to give her up, even upon finding out that she is a Jew. On the flip side, she becomes enemies with people on the resistance side who are actually collaborators with the Nazis and have betrayed the resistance consistently in order to become rich. It is this ethical relativism that makes Black Book stand out from the crowd in WWII films. Though films such as Stephen Daldry's The Reader have tried to paint a Nazi guard as sympathetic, it did so through the guise of having her engage in a pedophilic relationship with a young man. Black Book, fortunately, does not take this approach. Instead, it humanizes him through his love and stances taken in favor of Ellis, much to his detriment with the Nazis. He is a simple man who loves collecting stamps and is not the monster the Dutch perceive him to be. By the time the film ends, his death is one that is greatly mourned by Ellis and the audience alike."", ""The action sequences and moments of suspense are equally well handled by Verhoeven. We know he knows how to make a great action set piece through his work on RoboCop or Starship Troopers and Black Book is no exception. Brilliantly filmed, choreographed, and exuberant action scenes both thrill and instill great awe throughout the film as the men weave through the Nazi headquarters and the streets of Holland. Of course, one of the great flaws in many war or pseudo war films is its characters. Here, this is true as many characters blend together or are underdeveloped, such as staunch Christian Theo (Johnny de Mol). Now, the counter argument is that this is Rachel/Ellie's film and her story, which is fair. That said, the sprinkles of characterization we receive for everybody else is often not sufficient. Fortunately, the film does enough to highlight key motivations and traits of important players that foreshadow and drops hints for the audience to pick up on that play key roles later on."", ""A thrilling, unpredictable, and greatly dramatic WWII thriller, Black Book finds that director Paul Verhoeven still knows sex, violence, and thrills, and can find ways to make these feel unique and thoroughly engaging. At every turn, Black Book is a great exercise in ethical relativism and a terrific look at the Nazis reign of terror in Holland the betrayal that ensued across the country and across Europe in the wake of occupation."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

I admit to laughing at times (such as the line \""So you're saying that without Hitler we wouldn't exist?\""), but as a whole, Storytelling is a heartbreaking tale. What that tale is truly about is diverse, as it feels like this film is simply about rejection and life as a whole. Life is unfair and senseless with Todd Solodnz having serious contempt for that harshness and the unlevel playing field we all face. A truly hollow viewing experience, Storytelling is a tough film to assess simply because it just leaves you feeling defeated and empty above all other feelings."", """", ""The theme of rejection is quite clear from the get go, in both the \""fiction\"" and \""non-fiction\"" sections of the film.

As a result of this rejection, Marcus dumps his classmate girlfriend Vi (Selma Blair) who then goes on to having violent, rapey sex with Mr. Scott. When Vi tries to write about it, it is criticized as being unbelievable, sexist, and racist, despite her pleas that it is true. The same thing occurs in the non-fiction section as Toby Oxman (Paul Giammati) has been rejected in all of his endeavors.

With a deep anger towards this harshness, Solodnz lashes out by demonizing Mr. Scott in the \""fiction\"" section and killing Scooby's family in the \""non-fiction\"" (note how Consuela kills them, who is looked down upon by the family). Both sets of characters resoundly reject those around them, are incredibly priviledged and prejudiced, while also being self-obsessed and narcissistic."", """", ""This ties into the unfairness of everything in the film. In the \""fiction\"" section, Marcus is a kid trying to overcome his disease, yet faces obstacles at every turn and feels like a failure. Vi is raped, yet nobody believes her and writes her off as a racist. In the \""non-fiction\"" section, Scooby is mocked for being lost. Toby is written off as a loser, even by the audience. Brady (Noah Fleiss) is a relatively nice kid, yet he winds up in a coma after a freak football accident. Consuela (Lupe Ontiveros), the Livingston's family housekeeper, is fired simply because the Livingston's youngest son Mikey (Jonathan Osser) is a privileged and spoiled jerk who seems unable to feel any empathy whatsoever. This, of course, comes after Consuela's son is executed after being on death row. Maybe he deserved it, but Consuela certainly did not. Throughout the film, Solodnz is obsessed with examining unfairness and this unlevel playing field through the eyes of the disenfranchised, physically disabled, and the misunderstood. In many ways, these mirror himself as his films have often been written off by critics or simply misunderstood. Fortunately, Solodnz will not lash out by killing them all, but they should take this film as his letter of contempt."", """", ""As a film, Storytelling is incredibly well-written, creating engaging characters left and right.

This is largely in part to Solodnz's ability to create deeply relatable characters and trust in his audience. He trusts us to get these people and we most certainly do at every turn."", """", ""The key to understanding Storytelling lies in Toby's documentary in my personal opinion. Many label this a comedy and Solodnz as \""cruel\"" for mocking these characters. Yet, he is simply showcasing the contempt audiences have for these characters. He presents them in an unbiased manner and begs you to feel bad for them. Yet, all we can do is laugh. This is truly tragedy at its very finest as Storytelling leaves you hollow and empty as you watch these characters pushed down and left for dead at every turn without any hope for their futures. Scooby will fail out. Toby's film will fail. Consuela will never find steady work again at her age. Heartbreaking, taboo, and deeply misunderstood, Storytelling is a stirring look at rejection and the unfairness of society with Solodnz lashing out violently at both."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0
the-devils-backbone;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;Dec 27, 2016;"[ ""Set in a Spanish orphanage with the backdrop of the Spanish Civil War, The Devil's Backbone is very much a Guillermo del Toro film. Combining the destruction of innocence as a result of violence and abandonment with a political allegory regarding the Civil War, del Toro knows how to make a film. Billed as a horror film, The Devil's Backbone takes yet another page of the del Toro playbook by using a creepy atmosphere and elements of horror (such as ghosts) to tell a story that is not intended to scare you. Akin to later works such as Pan's Labyrinth, Crimson Peak, or The Orphange (which he produced), The Devil's Backbone explores larger topics through the use of this atmosphere and things often used in horror films. Here, del Toro comments on the Spanish Civil War. With strict and cruel leaders in charge, the abandoned children are on their own with limited movement and food. Yet, they are able to use their numbers, determination, and minds to overcome their oppressors."", ""With a creepy atmosphere, del Toro is able to create a film that plays on childish fears and misunderstandings. Largely told through Carlos (Fernando Tielve), a newly orphaned child, the film features a childlike sense of wonder and confusion at his newfound living situation. This confusion leads to fear and incredible tension that the film is able to utilize in introducing its ghost. With a good build-up with multiple bumps in the night, the film's horror elements work well, even if the film itself is never overtly scary. Had this not been a del Toro film, I would have been on pins and needles expecting a malevolent being to be haunting this orphanage. This is certainly a credit to him and the atmosphere he is able to conjure up in this film. The ghost itself has great special effects and looks the part. He adds a mystery element to this film as you begin to wonder how he came to be, but as it typical for del Toro, the explanation involves a great atrocity that had gone under-the-radar and been forgotten."", ""Politically, The Devil's Backbone finds its greatest success. Creating a parallel between the struggles of the orphans and the pains of the Spaniards under Franco, the film highlights the authoritarian nature of Franco through the oppression of the children. Abandoned and left to fend for themselves, Jacinto (Eduardo Noriega) is an intimidating figure of the children. Having injured Carlos and willing to commit atrocities in the name of gold, Jacinto is a man who was once an orphan, but has become a truly evil man. Representing Franco while the kids represent the Spaniards, del Toro shows how the country came together and, even if they were weaker and smaller, used their camaraderie and numbers to overcome their oppressor. In this way, The Devil's Backbone transcends the horror genre and instead becomes a piece of political commentary and represents del Toro's fantastical view of the Spanish Civil War through the eyes of children. In a way, this introduces themes and ideas he later revisited in Pan's Labyrinth, which I believe to be a stronger film. However, as a companion piece, The Devil's Backbone is undeniably powerful and yet another great work by del Toro."", ""Acting-wise, the film is impressive. For so many child actors, the acting is The Devil's Backbone is of an incredibly high quality. The entirety of the cast nails their respective roles and the kids bring an incredible authenticity to their roles. At all times, you believe they are going through this situation and are forced to deal with the agony of the terror surrounding them. They are able to approach the situation with the innocence and sense of imagination of a child, creating methods of coping that obscure what is actually occurring (the comics). However, in saying that, watching their innocence be shattered by the peril they face is tragic and thoroughly impactful."", ""Not really a horror film, The Devil's Backbone is more a fantastical exploration of the Spanish Civil War through political allegory and the eyes of children. A tragic and often hard to watch film, The Devil's Backbone shows the destruction of innocence at the hands of tyranny and the violence needed to overcome that authority. Powerful, poignant, and atmospheric, The Devil's Backbone once again demonstrates that nobody does child-like wonder blended with violence like Guillermo del Toro."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

The horror is never cheap and the psychological element really does mess with you and scare you pretty thoroughly at times. However, this film truly rides on atmosphere and its well-adapted script with a seriously spooky air to the film and well made characters. As a whole, 1408 lived up to my expectations and managed to exceed them, but really delivered a thought-provoking look at many different elements that make the film worthy of a closer look."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

Truly a masterful performance from Crowe, his performance makes the film, though the film  itself is certainly interesting. Ron Howard's direction is typically strong here and he does a good job telling the story of famed mathematician John Nash. However, where this film is most strong in terms of story is in its telling of Nash's struggle with schizophrenia. In a way, it really opens your eyes as to how it is to live with schizophrenia and suffering through the delusions associated with it. In a sense, this is one of the better films on mental disease ever made as it paints a very real, distressing, and disturbing portrait, all of which make you appreciate the genius of Nash all the more."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

Showing how one can be distressed and left hurt by looking to the past and waiting for it to change, Chungking Express features characters that are so incredibly real, the emotion they communicate cannot be ignored."", """", ""With incredibly written dialogue, Chungking Express brings its two lonely men to life with lines that absolutely touch your soul. For example, one describes how a girl who wished him a happy birthday will live on in his memories forever, only to then wonder when a memory expires. Lines such as these will overcome inadequacies in the film as a whole, as they transcend the medium. Instead, it makes the experience feel incredibly real and authentic. Wong Kar-wai's film may feel as though it is occurring at a distance from the audience, but lines such as these make the film realize that there is no distance at all. This is not a romance film, rather it is one about lost love and the pain it can cause. As such, it is an incredibly cold film, but not emotionless."", """", ""Stylistically, the film uses a ton of hand-held camera, if not solely hand-held. The end result is a kinetic and chaotic experience that highlights the loneliness of its protagonists. As the city and even their lives (as cops) run around hectically, their love life and home life remain empty and filled with solitude. It is always lovely when a director's style matches some element of the film and offers its own thematic elements. This is very much the case with Chungking Express. Additionally, the film is just simply very well shot. Hand-held cameras can be quite nauseating and annoying when noticeable, yet Chungking Express deftly avoids these trappings and instead utilizes the style effectively. Essentially, it is supposed to put you into the scene. The camera does this here, but certainly not always."", """", ""A thoroughly melancholy and moving experience, Chungking Express will make you feel its characters loneliness in a very human way that will more than likely break your heart. Both this and In the Mood for Love (the other Wong Kar-Wai film I have seen), both have this quality that make you think they will be a romance film and certainly play out like a romance film should, but they are anything but romance films.

Additionally, the film manages to thrill at all turns as you attempt to figure out what the jury will decide in this landmark and racially divisive case. Can a black man receive a fair trial in Mississippi? Should he be guilty regardless? A morally difficult film about vigiliantism, the film can be quite one sided and not all of the characters are well put together, but the acting and dialogue more than fix these problems. McConaughey is terrific and Samuel L. Jackson is great with a passionate and typically fiery performance as the father who exacted revenge on the men who raped his daughter.

This praise is certainly very fair. As with the rest of the film, it shows signs of its low-budget indie status, but cinematographer Tim Orr does a terrific job in this film.

With believable characters who also happen to be incredibly relatable, Green does a great job developing his characters and giving them appropriate responses to the challenges that arise throughout the film. No matter what happens, they all react in ways that are certainly within their character. While the film is named George Washington, I would not say that George Richardson is the only kid with any development. Instead, the whole cast of characters is given background without any exposition. Instead, it just shows you and trusts its audience to understand that this is who the character is and where they come from. Coming from the day and age in which exposition is king, George Washington is a true breath of fresh air in that regard."", """", ""That said, the voice-over can be a bit much and is the main detraction from an otherwise very good film. Often a little wordy, the voice-over is delivered by a 12-year old girl and sounds far deeper than any 12-year old I have ever met. Thus, an incredibly believable film outdoes itself a little bit with this element as it feels as if it is very much in contrast with all of the other positives of the film. Without the voice-over and attempted depth, George Washington could have been truly great."", """", ""Overall, though it shows signs of its low-budget, David Gordon Green's slice of life film George Washington is an often moving look at youth, growing up, death, and this summer that will live on it the memories of its character for the rest of time.

The cinematography is also great as it really manages to perfectly capture the look and feel of old Los Angeles and, most impressively, makes this film look timeless.

From weirdos in Vegas to a pair of kids who were clearly prepared for the attack, the President, the military, and rednecks in Kansas, Mars Attacks! offers some political insight, but more or less settles for being tongue-in-cheek science fiction film and I was more than okay with this approach."", ""Spoofing 1950s science fiction films, Mars Attacks! features an ensemble cast led by Jack Nicholson, Glenn Close, Annette Bening, Pierce Brosnan, Danny DeVito, Martin Short, Sarah Jessica Parker, Michael J.

This cast hams it up a ton in their various roles with each of them engaging in hysterical encounters with the attacking alien forces. As for standouts among this cast, Nicholson is a big highlight in a duel role as the President and, in Vegas, as real estate developer Art Land. Offering two very different performances between the serious President and the outlandish and crazy Art Land, Nicholson is both a calming presence and a great source of dry humor in the film.

Yet, in terms of spoofing the genre, its depiction of the United States is great. Dignified, advanced, and self-assured, the generals and President are quickly bamboozled by the aliens who use their own inventions as comedic tools (the translator running gag is great). Even better, the use of nuclear weapons being quickly embraced by the aliens is tremendous, as is the full-scale invasion of Washington DC, the use of the Washington monument, and the mayhem in the White House. All are uproariously absurd and keep making you wonder, \""Did that really happen?\"", but the answer to this question is also, unequivocally, \""Yes and it was glorious.\"" By mocking the death of a useless Congress, the ineffectiveness of the nuclear bomb, the gung-ho general, and peace-loving President and Professor, Mars Attacks! really satirizes many elements of politics and it is hard to say what side the film comes down on.

Spoofing B-movies and 1950s paranoia-laced science fiction horror, Mars Attacks! demands that its audience be willing to go along with it throughout. This does not mean shutting off your brain or anything stupid like that.

Unfortunately for them, their spouses heavy travel schedule leaves prevents any of these interactions from actually taking place, thus leaving them in eternal limbo as they await their returns.

By the film they are willing to move on their love, time has passed and they simply can no longer because together as life has brought them extenuating circumstances."", """", ""A decidedly melancholy film steeped in themes of respect and loneliness, In the Mood for Love only subtly pays off on its hinting at the main characters' love. Though Mr. Chow and Mrs. Chan certainly hit it off and love spending time with another, the film goes out of its way to showcase the two of them maintaining their purity and not becoming their spouses. Instead, they hold themselves back and keep on just being friends. Wong does great at capturing this element as the romantic tension and longing between the two shines through in large part to the camera work and acting."", """", ""In the Mood for Love is incredibly slowly paced, which allows for the full emotional impact of their trauma and regrets to really linger with this audience. Even more, this slow, methodic pacing almost becomes wholly melodic and poetic as Wong weaves his way through this relationship, the crumbling of their marriages, and their later attempts to reconnect but to simply be kept apart. In particular, the discussion of the old method of hiding secrets and then seeing Mr. Chow do exactly as he described while in the ruins of Cambodia is a truly moving and poetic ending to the film. Yet, incredibly subtle and restrained, as is the case with Wong's characters. Plus, this scene does a great job capturing larger topics in the process. it was not just our two protagonists whose lives changed, but also all of Hong Kong. As hinted to at the end, Hong Kong has changed dramatically since they met four years prior to the end of the film. Not only have their former landlady's moved out, but times have changed and people are moving on. The fact that Wong chose to end the film in Cambodian ruins is also attached to this element, considering it is a very visual representation of the way in which time moves on and leaves destruction, ruins, and memories in its wake. The camera work in this final sequence is particularly moving as it moves through these Cambodian ruins as Mr. Chow visits them."", """", ""Ultimately, Kar-Wai Wong's In the Mood for Love is a truly tragic exercise in heartbreak, repression, and loneliness. Though these two may love one another, they simply cannot allow themselves to express this in the conservative Hong Kong. If they did, it would be the end of them socially. Thus, they remain silent. Wong does a tremendous job capturing their chemistry even in silent moments and developing his characters, as well as their relationship. Wholly authentic, In the Mood for Love is a film that may be very slow, but it is a truly melodic and poetic experience."" ]";0;0;0;0;1;0
the-evil-dead-1983;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;Jun 16, 2017;"[ ""Sam Raimi's The Evil Dead is a truly frustrating film to watch. Throughout the entirety of the film after the young college-age protagonists arrive at their cabin in the woods, it is impossible not yell out, \""USE THE AXE!\"" or \""USE THE GUN!\"" It is just one of those horror movies, I guess, where characters have weapons sitting right next to them and instead they opt to let the demon zombie continue to live and just sit right in front of them without doing anything. Nonetheless, this oddly a major part of the film's charm as a pulse pounding and thoroughly thrilling romp through the middle of nowhere while zombies possess everybody in this cabin. Luckily for them, they have the man who will become Ash Williams (Bruce Campbell) at the helm, ready to discover his true calling in life: putting zombies on ice."", ""Providing scares from the moment this pack of morons find a spooky recording summoning demons from the Book of the Dead, Raimi's film consistently uses some exciting ways of spooking the audience and leaving us on edge. With the cryptic nature of that message being read as he shows us something coming to life under the soil, Raimi's film begins to fully realize the tension that had only been hinted at from the beginning. This hinting takes on the form of absolutely brilliant handheld point-of-view shots of something lurking outside of the cabin. Hanging about outside and whispering to Cheryl (Ellen Sandweiss) to \""join us\"", Raimi smartly leaves us in the dark as to what is awaiting these kids before we finally get introduced to the sinister evil bubbling underneath the floor boards of this cabin in the woods. It is a terrifying way to build suspense without tipping the film's hand and it is only a mere hint at how scary this film will become."", ""Through explosively campy and low-budget gore and make-up, The Evil Dead keeps the mood relatively light for how dark its plot becomes, but that does not mean it is not a horror film at its core. With tense and thrilling encounters between the kids and their now possessed friends, the film constantly shows the horror of having to kill your friends to survive, while also delivering terrific zombie scares throughout. Featuring an unsettling score that is occasionally accompanied by a truly haunting heartbeat sound and liberal usage of oblique angles when the climax arrives, The Evil Dead is a film that has no problem leaving the audience sweating what is awaiting Ash around the next corner. Compared to Army of Darkness, this initial entry into the trilogy is a lot less tongue-in-cheek and that lack of one-liners is felt when the zombies are around every corner and Ash has no idea how to finish them off. It is tense, thrilling, and an edge-of-your-seat thrill ride that will leave you curling up while wondering if you need to look away or not. It is truly unbridled fun that knows it is fun, but never lets that fact obscure just how scary the film becomes."", ""As with many horror films, The Evil Dead certainly has something going on with the women in the film, namely Cheryl. The first one to get attacked by the demons, she runs in the woods (horrible idea) and gets attacked by the trees. Holding her down, ripping her clothes off, showing us a boob, and then having a tree branch penetrate her, the film quite overtly creates a rape scene. Many horror films include vaginal or penile imagery and this film is certainly no exception as that scene demonstrates. With many horror films also killing those who have sex during the course of the film, it is certainly not far-fetched to believe the two are firmly intertwined. Playing up on the typical sensuality felt when a sex scene is in a film by draping it in blood, guts, and horror, horror films manage to make the audience even more uncomfortable. It is unsettling to watch Cheryl get attacked by the trees and it is only worsened by how vulnerable she is when the trees strip her down. It seems as though there is nowhere to go as it violates it and puts a demon inside her and that inevitability at a point when she is so vulnerable and unprotected is really what makes the scene so effectively terrifying."", ""Scary and thrilling throughout, The Evil Dead lacks the comedic bite of Army of Darkness and with how bad the effects are, that may not be a good thing. However, Raimi plays it so light with some self-awareness about how dumb it all looks that it winds up remaining truly scary and yet not scarring. That said, it was probably a good idea to turn its sequels into horror comedies, if only because it plays so nicely into Sam Raimi's wheelhouse and skillet. However, as a more straight-up horror film, The Evil Dead delivers the goods in a fun and thoroughly spooky film."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0
twin-peaks-fire-walk-with-me;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;Aug 28, 2017;"[ ""A descent into the hellish mind of resident cinematic mad scientist David Lynch, Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me is the prequel to his surreal early 1990s television series Twin Peaks, which was recently revived by Showtime. Introducing us to this sadistic and surrealist world, Fire Walk With Me starts off withe murder of Teresa Banks (Pamela Gidley), the disappearance of FBI agent Chester Desmond (Chris Isaak), and then moves into the central mystery regarding the suspicious incidents happening to high school prom queen Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee) in the lead up to her death. From what I gather, her death is the mystery explored in the original television series. What is perhaps the most interesting is how little is actually revealed. Sure, we see what kills her here, but that is hardly the only bit that is important. A film that defies definition and reaches comical levels of Lynchian absurdity, Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me is simply a damn good time if you are a film lover who adores being thoroughly confused."", ""What is perhaps most obvious in this film is the balance between heaven and hell that Lynch creates. With references to how, once you walk with the fire, it consumes you entirely with innocence the first thing to go. Read as being in reference to hell fire or walking in sin, Laura Palmer exemplifies this by working as an apparent sex worker who goes to seedy, red-tinted dance halls with creepy men who give her drugs. In dancing with the devil in such a fashion, Laura has let her soul come into direct contact with danger that leaves her open to losing her soul entirely to the pits of hell. With a scene calling back to Rosemary's Baby, Lynch shows what appears to be Laura's father or some other guy named Bob (it flips between the two) mounting Laura as she sleeps, clawing with long finger nails against her body, and thrusting as she slowly wakes up, leading her to wonder if it was all a dream or not. This scene is certainly similar to Rosemary's Baby when Mia Farrow's character is raped by Satan in a dream-like sequence. In many films, such as Angel Heart or The Devil's Advocate, Satan is depicted as having long, gnarly looking nails and the character of Bob has these exact same nails."", ""The further she descends into madness and sin, Laura loses sight of any of the light of God in the film. In an early shot, Lynch shows a painting on her wall that has an angel serving food to children. Later, this angel is gone. In a scene where she is being attacked along with a friend also caught in this life, the friend is able to escape after a guardian angel arrives to untie her hands. Laura, however, is left to deal with every bit of the terror that her sinful ways has brought upon her. While perhaps not the most important theme, it is clear that there is some evil forces  bubbling under the surface here with these nefarious characters clear depictions of absolute evil in our world, capable of destroying the purity, innocence, and mental health of those who give into their temptations purely by being in their presence."", ""In line with this concept of purity, Lynch places with ideas regarding incest and the protective nature of fathers throughout. Creating horror out of images of Laura's father Leland (Ray Wise) seeing her getting awaiting his arrival to the bedroom after he had asked Teresa to bring her friends to their next encounter, the film dances with going all the way as Leland/Bob/Satan mounts her in the bedroom and has sex with her. This incestuous relationship is naturally jarring to watch unfold and one that neither wants, with both sharing repulsed glances at one another once they know the devious lifestyle the other leads that has led to some unwelcomed shoulder rubbing as a result. On one hand, the film manages to create horror and tension out of this weird relationship between the two that often spirals into absolute insanity, while also calling into question just who Leland is and why he is being used to get closer to Laura in this way."", ""Much of the horror shared between Leland and Laura is derived from the natural desire of a father to protect his daughter from growing up and meeting seedy characters. Seeing her as a sexual being is not just jarring, but Leland seeing her somebody being prepped for a man as sexually depraved as himself really does him in completely. He knows that Laura is just like the girls he sees, none of whom he actually respects. Thus, it is no surprise to see him freak out on her to wash her hands when he sees her after their unfortunate near-encounter in the bedroom. Yet, it is clear that this is not just some simple case of a father trying to protect his daughter from sex. By rubbing shoulders with these evil characters in his own journey through the film's story, Leland knows the dangers they pose to him, let alone his previously innocent and proper daughter Laura."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

Jennifer Jason Leigh and Jude Law's performances are very good here and, though some would call them wooden, it is purposeful here, so they did a good job capturing that. Additionally, the film really messes with your mind and makes you question reality incredibly well.

A film about quiz shows and how fixed they truly are, this one really manages to create incredible tension throughout as you watch everything unfold. There were numerous scenes that had me on the edge of my seat waiting to see what unfolded, which I most certainly did not expect. An interesting film about networks, how they operate, and how they create/market celebrities to the public, Quiz Show is a film that often gets lost in the shuffle of the 1990s, but that is too bad. Ultimately, nothing it reveals is overly groundbreaking, yet it still manages to really captivate its viewers and provide an interesting statement on networks and the idea of celebrity.

Plus, every scene never really ceased to be funny, as Bill Murray was undeniably at his very best in this film, both as a comedian and as an actor. In addition, the moral and events of this one are almost always very touching when they are not funny. Watching Phil Collins transform as a human being by living the same day is a great thing to watch and is also a credit to the great script for this one. The script manages to tell a story that has been told many times before in a very fresh and unique way, while almost tricking us into thinking it is brand new. That is not bad thing either, as it really makes this film all the more enjoyable and always leaves you wondering what is ahead next.

A confusing and convoluted film, Lost Highway's true interpretation is as hard to pin down as any other Lynch film, though it is perhaps a bit more accessible than, say, Mulholland Dr. In essence, Lost Highway is a film about the underbelly of society. Porn, sex, murder, and temptations abound in David Lynch's mesmerizing tale of a man who has opened his home to Satan and cannot get him out of his place. Told in the only way Lynch knows how - confusingly - Lost Highway can be off-putting, but for those willing to get swept up in its whirlwind, it is more than satisfying."", ""Satan has entered the home of the Madisons. This much is clear. If the suggestions in the beginning of the film that Renee Madison (Patricia Arquette) was different and not like herself, the conversation between Fred Madison (Bill Pullman) and the mystery man (Robert Blake) cement it. Telling Fred that this mystery man is in his home and also showing that he is the source of the videotapes they have received hinting at Fred murdering Renee, it becomes clear that Satan has a hold on this family. How did he get into the home of Madisons? Via Renee. Just as Eve is the reason sin entered the world after she bit the apple from the tree of knowledge, Renee is a sex worker and porn star. By engaging in these sins and keeping the company of Mr. Eddy/Dick Laurent (Robert Loggia), who has clearly sold his soul for money and fame, Renee allowed Satan into the home of her and her husband. Once this happens, Satan lets himself into the home and toys with the Madison's and messes with the mind of Fred. Sending him to jail and then dumping him briefly into the body of Pete Dayton (Balthazar Getty), Satan has his way with the Madison's, but ultimately gets his reward: their souls. Helping Fred kill Dick Laurent and welcoming Renee's nude body into his previously burning cabin, the Madison's souls are no longer their own. The transaction is, of course, orchestrated by Renee who says that the man who lives in the cabin will help her and her lover disappear."", ""Sin engulfs the entirety of this film with the porn tape between Renee and various people playing throughout much of the final half hour of the film. People are murdered or driven off the road by men like Mr. Eddy or they engage in a variety of other sins throughout the film. This indulgence and embrace of the underbelly of society wreaks havoc on the family unit and destroys it thoroughly. In many ways, Lost Highway crafts an ode to films such as Rosemary's Baby or a companion piece to fellow 1997 release The Devil's Advocate. All show the temptation of sin and the potential rewards of selling your soul, but they always come in this world. Once it is over, the fire rages all around (as it does in the Madison's fireplace and in the cabin) and nothing but the gnashing of teeth remains. This film and the others show the aftermath of this and the pain, strife, and threat posed to our lives if we allow Satan in via our own sinful tendencies."", ""A thoroughly hypnotic and freak experience, Lost Highway features a lot of similar traits to Lynch's works, namely wooden acting and weird people. Pullman and Arquette are terrific, however, and portray these sort of alien and confused people unaware of what hell their actions have awakened. The film is often stolen by Robert Blake, however, as the mystery man whose always looming presence is terrifying and thoroughly unsettling from beginning to end. Robert Loggia is also great in a truly intense and angry performance, instilling great fear and presence whenever he appears on the screen."", ""Lost Highway is a divisive film, but is an equally horrifying one that really feels Lynchian from beginning to end. A parable on the dangers of giving into temptation and making deals with the devil for success on Earth, the film is hypnotic, mesmerizing, and perverse. Yet, it is also brilliant and a truly surreal experience as with all of his works. Nobody makes unique films like David Lynch and every single one of his films continues to defy expectations and pre-conceived notions about the film."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

Not only does it set it apart from other Westerns, but it breathes a certain amount of life into the film that is very beneficial.

Thoroughly Scorsese, the film is brilliantly captured from the cinematography to the staging with ambitious camera movements, transitions, and techniques utilized throughout. Matching the beautiful camera work, the film's plot is elegant and its dialogue is structured and stiff, perfect for the society portrayed. Set in the 1870s, the film is about a man named Newland Archer (Daniel Day-Lewis). Awaiting marriage to May Welland (Winona Ryder), he becomes infatuated with the Countess Ellen Olenska (Michelle Pfeiffer), who recently returned to New York society after time in Europe with her now-estranged husband, the Count. Now caught between what he should do and what he wants to do, Newland must make a decision that will have ramifications for centuries. Elegant, engaging, and gorgeous, The Age of Innocence may be too stiff for some, but for those willing to go along with it, it is a brilliant take down of New York society."", ""With an elegant, romantic, and truly rapturous score accenting the film, The Age of Innocence was always destined to be gorgeous. The score by Elmer Bernstein is tremendous and often takes center stage in this film with so many different highlights. Paired up with the tremendous score is the brilliant production design. Capturing the prim nature of the society, the buildings from the exterior and in the interior are dressed to the nines. Scenes of snow falling in the city only further highlight the beauty of the film's production design and the emotional coldness of its characters and the society in which they live. While the buildings are gorgeously crafted, they are hardly lively and instead represent the same structured and stiff nature of the society itself. The costume design, also beautiful, similarly communicates this rigidity. With corsets and detailed dresses that make statements on their own, this society is one that constantly demands its participants be \""on\"". If a person is unable or unwilling to perform for society's eyes, they will not be accepted into the society. The terrific costume design highlights this with every woman dressed up for a ball throughout and the men all wearing suits that exceed their \""Sunday best\"". Yet, the film is defined in small touches. For example, a windy day where all the men walk the streets and hold their bowler hats as they do so, for fear of it flying off due to the wind. The film is bolstered by small, detailed moments such as this and it it something that is found in the score, the production design, and the costume design."", ""In terms of the film's camera work, it is wholly unique. Naturally, there are eye candy shots in the cinematography of old New York, the homes of the people, and a gorgeous aerial shot that is quintessential Scorsese during the opening ball sequence. Shots set against the shoreline of Countess Olenska staring at the ocean with everything draped in an orange hue also stands as a true series of highlights, whether it be with the sun setting behind the lighthouse, a boat, or Countess Olenska. Yet, again, the film has some small touches that make its camera work truly stand out. Early in the film, it is marked by a sort of symmetry to the shots. The staging of people, candles, or paintings, highlight this symmetry that is not necessarily continued throughout, but is definitely worth mentioning and eye catching. What makes this camera work unique is Scorsese's usage of lighting and the frame. For example, a sequence with Countess Olenska and Newland at the theatre, already in the throws of subtle courting, Scorsese uses a truly odd technique. For lack of a better term, it is a sort of racking iris. It is a spotlight placed on the two as they converse, highlighting how they are in a world of their own. The sound cuts out except for their conversation, in spite of being in a loud theater. They have eyes only for one another and the spotlight emphasizes this with the two staring longingly at one another. As the scene progresses, an angelic white light begins to appear behind Countess Olenska, further making her enticing and hinting at Newland's impending obsession with her and possessing her love and affection. This technique later returns towards the end of the film when Newland reads a letter to May from Countess Olenska in which she outlines her intentions to leave for Europe and return to her husband. With this iris spotlight exclusively on Newland's eyes as he reads the letter, you can feel the hurt, the pain, and the sense of loss as he must now re-focus his love on May or forever chase Countess Olenska's love, which would only bring shame and scandal upon his and her family. Prior to this scene though, Scorsese has the curtains close on Newland and May. With black edge of the frame closing in slowly on the couple and then appearing to be a stage curtain, the chapter and scene ends."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

From serving Lord Darlington (James Fox), a naive man who got tricked by the Nazis into joining their cause, to serving former American congressman Jack Lewis (Christopher Reeve), Mr. Stevens has been around for a lot, but he has experienced very little. In the name of serving, he has sacrificed himself, his happiness, and his life to fulfill his duties as a man-servant with honor, dignity, and respect. By the time he begins to regret some of these choices and miss the things he looked past, it is far too late to actually go back and experience them. Brimming with rigidity and staunchly set in its period design and mannerisms, The Remains of the Day is a film about a man who was never afforded time to actually be himself."", ""Set in the British class system of the 1930s, Mr. Stevens is a man who puts dignity above all else. His father may be dying and he may be quickly gaining feelings for housekeeper Ms. Sally Kenton (Emma Thompson), but neither the loss nor the love are allowed to be felt. For one, his father would have wanted him to focus on his work and dignity. Second, it is improper for a butler to be married to a fellow servant. As such, neither event gets explored and instead, they get compartmentalized and dumped into the abyss Mr. Stevens has created within his soul. He is the human embodiment of Spongebob in the episode where he only knows \""fine dining and breathing.\"" However, the latter is entirely optional should he be requested otherwise. For Mr. Stevens, being a butler is his life. No matter how many dignitaries or politicians arrive at Darlington Hall, Mr. Stevens is oblivious to the goings on of the manor in regard to conversation. When it comes to running the place, he runs a tight ship and expects the very best of the fellow servants and holds them to the same standard he holds himself. Unfortunately, in shutting his eyes and ears to what goes on around the manor, he loses sight of events. While Lord Darlington quickly falling into the grasp of the Nazis, Mr. Stevens remains oblivious. He is just there to serve his well-mannered and gracious lord who is not to be questioned or debated with. Rather, he must only appear when requested and do as instructed. As time and life passes him by, Mr. Stevens remains committed to servitude, but with regrets. As the world around changes into one that is less structured and less focused upon gentlemanly behavior, he realizes that his efforts in remaining dignified may have been misguided. Above all, watching Ms. Kenton get married and divorced leaves him wondering what could have been had he actually indulged in his love for her, which was certainly requited. He was a man so committed to his career and a false sense of duty that he was unaware of the humanity of the home. He knew where everything went, where every room was, and what everybody's duty was in the home. However, when tasked with explaining the \""birds and the bees\"" to Mr. Cardinal (Hugh Grant), he was rendered speechless. Through working so much, he had forgotten what it mean to truly live his life. When there begin to be cracks in his own rough exterior, he tries to suppress them and throw himself into his work. Through years of service, he has learned how to not feel and just do. This, however, has left him frightfully unfulfilled and constantly forced to endure the solemn recognition that his dedication left him working through life and never taking time to smell the roses and enjoy life. Now that his time is becoming increasingly limited and any reunion with Ms. Kenton out of the question, things will only become lonelier for this man who sacrificed himself to what he believed to be a noble pursuit."", ""In many films that depict butlers, their actions and work are background noise to the important conversations going on. However, here, the work is front-and-center.

Featuring complete self-sacrifice and dedication, the life is not an easy one, but it is one approached with pride by men such as Mr. Stevens who find it to be an honor that he is able to sacrifice his life in such a way. This is his calling. His passion. He takes it seriously and expects everybody else to do so as well. Ivory's film honors the men and women who dedicate themselves to servitude and receive very little in return for their honor, dignity, and manners.

Hannah and Her Sisters is one of - if not the - best examples of this in Allen's work. Focusing on a series of characters undergoing crises in their lives, relationships, and careers, Hannah and Her Sisters is both funny and profound in ways that only a film by Woody Allen can aspire to be."", ""As always, the best part of any Woody Allen film is the writing and the characters. Hannah and Her Sisters is no exception. Witty and smart dialogue complements terrifically crafted characters. Hannah (Mia Farrow) craves affection internally, but is off-putting due to her appearance as the \""best\"" sister and being far more complete as a person than those around her. This can cause great tension for her and both the writing and Farrow's performance capture this dichotomy terrifically. She is dependent on her husband, Elliott (Michael Caine), but has no idea how to show this devotion. Similarly, Elliott is terrifically written as a man who lusts after Hannah's sister, Lee (Barbara Hershey). As opposed to Hannah's ex-husband Mickey (Woody Allen), his internal turmoil is much more internal and subtle, yet still ever present. Unsure of who he wants to be and his own life, Elliott's struggles lead him to stray, even if - deep down - he knows it will not satisfy him. However, one of my favorite characters here is Mickey. A hypochondriac who has an actual brush with death that leaves him lost, searching for meaning in life, and exploring religion, it is through Mickey that Allen really explores the meaning of the film. Hannah and Her Sisters is ultimately a film about life and finding purpose. Mickey, at one point, suggests the only point to life is love and that certainly seems to be the case here.  The characters have no other purpose and are left entirely unfulfilled until they are introduced to the one they are meant to be with, even if it does not click immediately. The only consistent thread throughout the whole film is the search for love. Every character does it and, once they find it, transform into an entirely new person."", ""This is really what makes the writing so strong. For a wide cast of characters, Hannah and Her Sisters slack with none of them and develops each sister, Elliott, and Mickey, with great dimension and craft that makes them wholly resemble a real human being. Each character has very human struggles and the film is unafraid to bring them to the forefront, allowing the film to be incredibly accessible and relatable to anybody searching for their purpose in life."", ""Hannah and Her Sisters continues to impress when considering the acting. As always, Allen's neurotic approach to his own character is charming, hilarious, and smart. He is greatly complemented here by a sturdy performance from Mia Farrow and an uncharacteristically neurotic performance from Michael Caine. Though less funny than Allen, Caine's character is certainly just as erratic and lost, yet Caine's approach is vastly different though still terrific. As Hannah's sisters, Barbara Hershey and Dianne Wiest are also terrific, as both women embark on their own personal journeys of self-discovery through the film. Lost entirely, Hershey greatly captures the way in which Lee is unsatisfied and going back to school in order to find her purpose. A typical path for many lost adults, Lee's story is certainly a highly relatable one and Hershey does a great job playing the role in a very grounded fashion.

on-the-waterfront;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;May  3, 2017;"[ ""Arguably director Elia Kazan's best known work, On the Waterfront features a career-high for both its director and its star Marlon Brando in this dramatic depiction of corruption, intimidation, and ambition. Set on the docks of New Jersey, the film shows the level of control possessed by mob boss Johnny Friendly (Lee J. Cobb). A terrifying presence, his shadow looms over inch of the waterfront, with him and his henchmen deciding who can actually work that day and who must go home. Corrupt and deeply involved in the criminal underworld, Friendly and his men seek to silence any possible \""cheese eaters\"" by any means necessary. Part of the peripheral of their crew is former boxer Terry Malloy (Marlon Brando). Working as a longshoremen, he is the young brother of Friendly's right hand man, Charley the Gent (Rod Steiger). This gives him ample opportunity at the docks, but also puts him in the crosshairs of the criminal case and, as such, finds himself getting squeezed by the cops. Starting a romance with pure girl Edie (Eva Marie Saint), Terry must decide whether he wants to remain loyal to Johnny or to himself."", ""Opening with one of the best first acts I have seen, in which Terry visits his friend Joey Doyle (Ben Wagner), On the Waterfront's opening sets the tone. Giving Joey a pigeon that he believes belongs to him, Terry is merely there to setup Joey. Professing later on that he thought that Johnny Friendly's men were just going to rough him up a bit and not kill him, this opening scene not only shows the vicious nature of the Friendly gang, but also sets up the conflict that will consume Terry's being. Feeling great remorse for getting his friend killed and then being unable to face Edie, Joey's sister, with the truth even when the two begin going together, Terry realizes his only way out is to rat. However, in doing so, everybody he loves will be put in danger. But, to not do so would be to become complicit in the continued exploitation of the longshoremen by the ruthless mobsters that run the union."", ""Through this tale of corruption and intimidation, On the Waterfront paints a frightening picture of blue collar America and how easily it can transform into lawlessness if a ruthless criminal gets their hands on it. Easily crushing all opposing forces due to the desperation in the area, Johnny Friendly is the gatekeeper  between being broke and being able to work for a living. In essence, he is the man capable of ruining you or helping you. His brutal killings and beatings of those that step out of line only further establishes him as the head honcho in the area and not a man to be toyed with. Leaning on a local priest, Father Barry (Karl Maiden), for help and strength, Terry must overcome his own issues and fears to be able to stand up to this powerful man and tell the truth to the courts. Through this, the film becomes not just scary portrayal of crime and its influence on the poor, but also on the strength and courage it takes to stand up in the face of absolute adversity."", ""One of the more apparent themes at play in On the Waterfront is ambition and life goals. Having become hardened over time due to his exposure to the crime underworld, Terry has largely given up on his dreams. Once a promising boxer, he had to throw away his career to allow the mob to win its bet on the fight. Now, he opts to avoid having dreams to avoid future pain. As a result, he never reached his potential in life and is left wallowing as a longshoreman that is considered a bum by everyone around him, even Edie's father and often times, Edie herself. Having passed on every opportunity before him and throwing away his life in the name of supporting his brother and Johnny, Terry must finally work towards his own goals. No longer can he put everybody else ahead of himself. Being selfish is a quality he desperately needs to learn, as without it, he is being trampled on by all the men on the docks. He is a man who feels he has failed in life and by ratting on the crime bosses, he can finally live up to his own expectations for himself and not be such a disappointment. He can be more than a bum and not have to worry about becoming a beggar on the streets. He can live in the comfort of the knowledge that he did what was right and lifted the control of the docks away from criminals."", ""Featuring a career-best performance from Marlon Brando, On the Waterfront may be a bit too melodramatic at times with a poor-to-mediocre romance given too much screentime, but on the back of excellent direction from Kazan and Brando's bravado, it lives up to its classic billing. Brando's authenticity as an actor and his committed performance as Terry really bring the film to life and make it feel akin to something out of the Italian neo-realism due to its intense focus on the harsh reality of life. Now, a lot of this is due to Kazan to be sure, but Brando brings truth to this representation of life. He is Terry Malloy. Terry Malloy is him."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

With terrific performances from Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe, American Gangster feels more like a 1970s-early 1990s gangster flick, rather than one released in 2007. With strong writing, good characterization, and a steady pace, the length of American Gangster never becomes a problem and the film never feels like it has filler. While it does pale in comparison to better gangster films like The Godfather or Goodfellas, it is a great look at New York City crime and Frank Lucas in particular, while serving as yet another showcase for Denzel Washington. A truly sprawling and epic feeling biopic, American Gangster successfully covers its subject, while expertly handling interweaving subplots and having a surprising lack of confusion when it comes to following both its plot and large cast of characters. Overall, American Gangster is a very good crime film that feels heavily indebted to gangster films of old."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

The film is also a surprising source of thrills and some horror movie elements (though not a horror movie by any means) in large part thanks to the great score, good sound, and creepy atmosphere fostered by the Coens.

Rather, it managed to have my attention from beginning to end trying to follow everything that was going on. For starters, the plot is a bit confusing and convoluted at times and that would be a bad thing if they did not resolve my questions at the end. Throughout, the tension is always present and keeps you on the edge of your seat as more and more questions get answered and the puzzle pieces start coming together. At the end of the day, it is amazing just how far some will go to keep their dirty secrets from being aired and, really, that is what this one is about. The film summary on many sites is somewhat accurate, but really fails to capture what this one is truly about. The writing here is also very sharp and the cinematography is very stylish as well. George Clooney is also great here, as well as Tom Wilkinson and Tilda Swinton in smaller roles. Then again, the acting as a whole was very good. Finally, the monologue delivered by Wilkinson at the beginning (and later finished as the story truly begins) is also phenomenally written and delivered. It really sets the tone for the rest of the film. Overall, \""Michael Clayton\"" is a good, tense thriller that is a bit slow and confusing at times, but is undoubtedly satisfying."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

Robert De Niro stars as the unhinged Max Cady and turns in a true iconic performance that lets him demonstrate his immense talent. In a career full of great performances, it is tough to say that one is better than the others, but this one has to be up there. De Niro is honestly phenomenal and creates chills like nobody else can. Nick Nolte is also quite good here and does a great job making the audience unsure on how to read his complicated character. We know he is not a good guy, but we undeniably side with him since he certainly made the right choice. That said, Scorsese is in full control here and shows his skill at creating atmospheric tension and pure suspense, more so than some horror directors out there. The only negative here is Juliette Lewis who turns in a mediocre performance among such a talented cast of actors. That said, Cape Fear is a truly chilling experience that will leave you closing the blinds and locking all the doors."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0
total-recall;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;Apr 19, 2017;"[ ""The original is it a dream or not film, Total Recall is yet another science fiction classic from director Paul Verhoeven. He knows how to make objectively fun films that are essentially the cinematic equivalent of wrestling. Loud, dumb, and obviously scripted, but since both he and the audience are in on the gag, it is fun to watch. Pairing this with a ripped and confused Arnold Schwarzenegger and a story based upon a short story from Philip K. Dick, you just know this is about to be an excellent watch. In many ways, it feels akin to Dune due to the obsession with control here on a distant planet, though in Total Recall it is air. Starring Schwarzenegger as Douglas Quaid, the film shows him as a relatively normal man married to Lori (Sharon Stone). However, as he goes to a company called Rekall, that allows people to pay to have memories implanted in their mind, things go haywire for him. Choosing to go to Mars and to become a secret agent, the route the film takes is ultimately up to the viewer. One side can claim it was all a part of the dream, but one that he began to believe. The other can claim that it is all true. He came to before the memory was implanted and after they had discovered he had his mind wiped due to the secrets he held from his time as a Mars Intelligence Officer that could threaten Vilos Cohaagen's (Ronny Cox) control over the air on Mars."", ""In many ways, Verhoeven reminds me of a more ambitious and unhinged version of David Cronenberg. Both are obsessed with constant depictions of sex and violence in their films, yet take different approaches to them. Verhoeven is more tongue-in-cheek, whereas Cronenberg is more serious. Yet, both share a similarity: inventiveness. From the gadgets in their films to the world they create, their films are always incredibly imaginative and demand further exploration. This is certainly part of the appeal of watching their films as around every corner is something you never imagined being in a film. This is an incredibly fun experience as a viewer as the weaponry, sets, and the world as a whole are so intricately designed that it makes it all seem real. Every detail is accounted for, even when the plot may become a little too odd to bear. This is a world that is always available to be explored and is a fun journey to be on throughout."", ""Yet, what this film thrives on is paranoia. With Douglas constantly told his true identity is Carl Hauser and that this is all a dream, he has no idea how to respond and neither does the audience. It is hard to pin down what is and is not real as things seem to be too finely put together by Hauser to not be a setup and things go too closely to what he signed up for with Rekall. Yet, other moments show that it is definitely not a dream with people turning against him or remembering him. Of course, that may be the very point. Total Recall walks a fine line between both options, but what is clear is the tension and paranoia this balance creates. It is excellent for entertainment purposes and really keeps you on edge as you try to figure out, scene-by-scene, what is really happening or what could be an implant."", ""An area of complaint for this film would definitely be the acting, which always a lot to be desired. Though, it may just be a trait of Paul Verhoeven films at this point. Inherently satirical in tone and style, the acting seems surreal with it simultaneously being unconvincing and overacted. This is a mainstay quality in many Verhoeven films with the actors seemingly in on the satirical tone of the film by playing their characters less than seriously. It is always jarring, especially with Arnold's constant one-liners littered throughout this film also contributing to this general feeling, but somehow thoroughly appealing to watch unfold at all times."", ""In watching Paul Verhoeven's filmography one thing, aside from the violence and sex, becomes immediately clear. Many of his female protagonists are quite similar and what I would like to categorize as the \""Verhoeven Woman\"". If Howard Hawks can have his own female cliche, I think Verhoeven definitely deserves some credit for his own cliche. With Lori (Sharon Stone) - Douglas' apparent wife - and Melina (Rachel Ticotin) - Douglas' apparent lover -  Total Recall introduces two Verhoeven women. Both women are overtly sexual and entirely objectified throughout. They ooze sex appeal and the film plays up this sexuality with both wearing greatly revealing clothing and constantly trying to engage Douglas in sex. Yet, this sexuality is always juxtaposed by Verhoeven with complete empowerment. Though these women may be agents forced to sleep with their marks or hookers who both suffer from the male gaze, they are completely capable and able to function on their own. Lori is a ball busting agent in Douglas' world and is more than capable of holding her own. She even skillfully takes down Douglas as any man with her training would be able to do."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

A film that is essentially just a \""day in a life\"" featuring two characters who simply run into each other and decide to spend the next day together, it is one that many will complain about \""nothing happening\"", yet that is its brilliance. It is simply a film about a chance encounter between two people with a major connection between them. What ensues is one of the best romantic films ever made with phenomenal writing (seriously, some of the dialogue here is perfection), great direction from Richard Linklater, and terrific acting from Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy. Both leads turn in very natural performances that fit in perfectly with the feel this one gives. Honestly, it feels like a documentary about two people who actually fell in love in Vienna.

About a couple - Ted (Dustin Hoffman) and Joanna Kramer (Meryl Streep) - who separate, divorce, and are now fighting a custody battle, the film is achingly real. Blessed with an authentic and heartbreaking script from Robert Benton, Kramer vs Kramer never ceases to both break your heart and be an absolutely riveting film. Praised for portraying the concerns of both Ted and Joanna evenly, Kramer vs Kramer may paint Joanna as a bad guy in the film, but her concerns are valid ones with regard to her marriage to Ted."", ""Ted, a workaholic, is a distant father. He provides financially, but misses the crucial part: emotion and low. His son Billy (Justin Henry) barely knows him. Joanna is done. She has been unhappy and forced to be a stay-at-home mom against her wishes, so she leaves. Ted is neglectful and old school with a set understanding of what a wife should be and do. This does not work for Joanna, so she leaves him and Billy to find herself and happiness. For the next 18 months, Ted and Billy fight and are forced to learn to live and love one another, while Ted is forced to parent. The end result is an unbreakable bond that Ted could never imagine having severed in the future. As such, he gets quite defensive when Joanna comes back with a job and wants to take her son back full-time. This is where Kramer vs Kramer fails to be fair, as it shows Ted and Billy for the most part. When Joanna gets Billy briefly for a visit, we only see how Ted handles giving him over. As such, we write off Joanna as a parent and start rooting for Ted to get the kid, even though this **** wants to take Billy away from him. That said, for his part, Hoffman has incredible chemistry with the young Justin Henry. Hoffman plays an incredibly sympathetic man with great gravitas and care for the nuance of parenthood. He refuses to demonize Joanna and instead begins to look inward and identify what made her run away. He knows he screwed up and feels great remorse for those errors."", ""On the flip side, Meryl Streep is impeccable. Her testimony is raw, powerful, and engrossing. Her delivery is always top-notch and it is hard to deny that this is a performance worthy of her first Oscar. She is limited in screen time compared to Hoffman, but she makes an impact every time she appears on the screen. As Joanna, she plays this forward-thinking mother who looks beyond the home for gratification and success. As such, a home life is at odds with what she truly wants. Though she loves Billy, having him live with her would be a mistake for the both of them, even if she is a good mother. Her realization of this is an incredibly powerful moment in the film and underscores Joanna's confusion and lack of focus in her life at the moment."", ""Impeccably written, as mentioned, the film's main fault is that it takes Ted's side. We understand Joanna, but never comprehend why she wants to take Billy away. Why must Ted be limited to every other weekend and she gets the kid? The film too readily cops out and blames archaic beliefs of the judge that mothers are more important when, in reality, it must explain why Joanna refuses joint custody and wants Billy full-time. The two could split him and the end result would be hard, but easy to understand. Yet, they go guns blazing at one another because Joanna wanted to. This is unfortunate and makes her hard to sympathize with, even if her reason for divorcing Ted makes sense."", ""A powerful film, Kramer vs. Kramer is a riveting and thoroughly engrossing family drama that has authenticity in every line. Hoffman and Streep turns in powerful performances as the warring couple, even if the writing seems to take Hoffman's side a bit too much. That said, it is an incredibly nuanced and timeless film that rides on the back of its impeccable characters, real life drama, and acting."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0
the-doors;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;Jan 24, 2017;"[ ""The Doors is hardly a biopic of Jim Morrison or The Doors. Instead, it is a gateway drug in the form a feature film. Through the life of Morrison, director Oliver Stone finds cinematic peyote and injects it into the veins of the audience and leaves us with an oddly spiritual experience. Hypnotic, indulgent, and excessive, Stone discards  the story of Jim Morrison and The Doors in order to tell a more compelling tale through the atmosphere of the film. In essence, he turns an otherwise cliche biopic into an experience that transcends its cliched trappings within the musician biopic subgenre. Adorning his film with the sexual escapades of Morrison, the making of songs, and a soundtrack complete with the greatest hits by the band, Stone's film is a transcendent biopic that feels eminently rich and entertaining."", ""This power and atmosphere of the film is defined very early on. Eschewing most of his childhood and just dropping him in college, the film briefly runs through the forming of the band in order to dump them in the desert. Having the band take peyote and trip together in order to get ideas for the film, it is here that Stone conjures the psychedelic feeling of the film of simulates an acid trip through his film. Shot throughout with an orange filtered haze, the film is hypnotic and continuously unexpected. It is also in this desert that Stone really finds his hero: Jim Morrison (Val Kilmer). Tossing aside most life details in favor of this aesthetic and atmosphere, Stone needed a man to carry it on their shoulders and Kilmer does exactly that. He disappears into the role and I had to constantly remind myself that this was Ice-Man from Top Gun. He is phenomenal to an unexpected degree and really embodies Morrison, but more importantly, embodies the feeling that Stone is trying to conjure. It is a match made in heaven between director and lead and the film benefits tremendously from their on-screen chemistry."", ""Yet, the clearest Stone comes to showing the audience that he could care less about the story is the San Francisco concert sequence. Opening with The Doors performing at an outdoor concert in the Bay Area, Stone keeps the music playing, but cuts through a very unique montage. Containing images of Jim participating in a witchcraft ritual to be united with some weird girl, people dancing nude around a fire at the festival, Jim catching Pam (Meg Ryan) cheating on him and taking heroin, Jim lighting his house on fire, and Native American spirits dancing with him on stage, the film is odd at this point. Yet, it is equally as gorgeous. Stone does not strike a balance between the aesthetic drug trips and Jim's reality. Instead, he goes full bore into the former. Those expecting a traditionally told biopic will come away disappointed because that was never Stone's intent. Instead, he wanted to drop his audience into the mind of Morrison and to see the world from his point of view. It is honestly the only way to sympathize with him and once we feel the drugs and negative influences in his life, it becomes obvious how this man died at 27."", ""It is this style that saves the film. While Stone makes the concert scenes powerful and epic, as they should be, the stylish storytelling and orange filtering cover up a largely run-of-the-mill tale. Stone takes no risks in the story itself, which becomes more noticeable after the hypnotic opening half hour. The indulgence in the sexual temptations experienced by Morrison is an unfortunate detour, but continues to show that his life was certainly done by the seat of his pants. Unfortunately, the rise and fall of his life is written in a pretty cliche manner, it is only once Stone gets his hands on the material that it truly soars and becomes an oddly beautiful biopic and a behemoth of one at that."", ""The Doors is an experience. Their music most certainly is, as the lyrics are hardly special. Rather, it is the feeling that it creates within you where the music finds its power. Oliver Stone knows this and seeks to create the same feeling from his film. He is certainly successful with the film transporting the viewer to an alternate dimension where Jim Morrison was possessed by Natives and that is hardly the weirdest thing the film convinces its audience of. It is indulgent, excessive, and off-the-wall. But, above all else, it is thoroughly engrossing, atmospheric, and completely epic.

Ultimately, Traffic is a brilliant look at the many different aspects and roles played in the world of drugs and how easily lines between good and bad can be blurred. On top of that, it reenforces that nobody involved can get away without being altered forever. Every story it goes through is interesting in their own way. Many call this a thriller, and while elements of this are indeed thrilling, it struck me more as a drama and I thought the dramatic elements outweighed the thrilling ones, but that is me.

For this one, the few actiony sequences were well done and very exciting and the thriller element was certainly there as the thrills, at times, really left you on the edge of your seat. The film is also very heartwarming as both Leon and Mathilda are in tough spots and really fill the holes in one another's hearts. At times, it can be a little creepy, but for the most part, their father-daughter esque relationship is charming, even if a bit odd to many. Overall, Leon: The Professional is a good film that has great performances, though that does not necessarily overshadow the other good qualities it brings to the table."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0
sabrina;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;Apr  9, 2017;"[ ""Long before Mike Nichols' released his masterpiece The Graduate in 1967, Humphrey Bogart's Linus Larrabee and writer/director Billy Wilder knew what the future held: plastics. That guy in The Graduate was a day late and a dollar short, even though he pretended to be ahead of the curve on plastics. Ha!"", ""Telling the story of a chauffeur's daughter who falls for one of the sons of the family he father works for, only to wind up being shipped off to France to lose this affection, only to return and fall in love with both him and his brother, Sabrina is an incredibly fun film. Starring Audrey Hepburn as the titular character, she may be much younger than either David (William Holden), her first love, or his brother Linus (Bogart), but still sells the romance incredibly well. Tremendously written and directed by Wilder, Sabrina is a light on its feet romantic comedy that consistently delivers laughs, charm, and wit, as this woman struggles with love only to find it in a place that she never expected."", ""Always radiant in her roles, Hepburn's naturally bubbly demeanor makes her a perfect match for the role of Sabrina. A Manic Pixie Dream Girl through and through, she exists to make Linus and David find themselves and embrace new possibilities in life to improve their happiness. Shipped off to France for two years to learn how to cook and get over David, she returns only to fall in love with both David and Linus again and then head off to Paris once more, except she will possibly not be alone. While the role is one that largely exists to open the eyes of her male counterparts, Hepburn makes Sabrina her own and really injects life into the role. Nominated for Best Actress for the role, it is immediately apparent why and it has nothing to do with her natural charisma and charm. While the comedic lines zip and the romance swoons, Hepburn's greatest characteristic is her eyes. She knew how to work her eyes and have them communicate an entire scene simply by emoting through her face and eyes. As she dances with David and Linus, you can practically read her thoughts through her frequent usage of non-verbal cues. While her natural bounce and radiance are certainly quite appealing and Hepburn makes great use of both in this dreamy role, she finds her best success in these non-verbal cues that communicate more than words ever could."", ""As one of her potential mates, Bogart plays the rough and tough-nosed Linus incredibly well. As is typical of Bogart roles, he has an incredibly hard exterior to the point that one begins to wonder if there is a beating hard inside or not. Running his father's company with his brother David more interested in chasing a new dame each week, Linus is business focused. Dating is not for him and he never even considered marriage. Instead, he is married to his job and would not want a woman to get involved in that, for fear of her getting hurt. Yet, as he shows with Sabrina, there is a heart inside after all. No matter how tough he appears to be and how career-focused he professes to be, he longs to have that connection with a woman, but is simply afraid to take that leap without being pushed. Once pushed, however, he falls hard and becomes a hopeless romantic. As the main recipient of Sabrina's dream girl powers, Linus finally embraces life's pleasures and is able to leave his office and find a love for experience and romantic indulgence."", ""His brother David similarly grows, even if the film does not really focus on him. From playboy to settled in engaged man, David learns to embrace the business side of his family and not always actively revolt against adulthood. Though forced into a marriage of convenience, he finds that everything is not so bad after all and he does actually love the girl he is marrying. Instead, similar to his brother, he was afraid to jump in and settle down, for fear of becoming an adult. Yet, through his encounters with Sabrina, he finally finds what he always wanted and was afraid to grab: a life that is not just bed hopping."", ""While its characters are admittedly a bit cliche by today's standards, they are all impeccably interesting and fun to watch grow throughout. Plus, while Sabrina may be a Manic Pixie Dream Girl, she does have a mind of her own and is not just some helpless girl. Instead, she desperately wants romance and will take whatever is given to her. When she cannot get this, she is entirely satisfied with running off to Paris and finding the romance she craves in the Parisian aesthetic that she so loves. That said, while the film's characters are a great credit to it, the film's comedy is really where it stands out. As a romantic comedy, the comedy is always crucial and the film's comedic wit and whip smart moments are really what makes this one so endearing and charming. Hepburn, Bogart, and Holden, certainly all contribute to this charm and speak to how well-cast the film was, but a lot of this charm is also found in the writing as the film just flies by"" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0
lost-in-america;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;Sep  4, 2017;"[ ""Perhaps one of the best directors who is never really spoken about as such is Albert Brooks. Delivering quality film after quality film in the 1980s and 1990s, Brooks is the indier version of Woody Allen. Often starring in his own films, exploring relationships between men-and-women, exploring mortality, exploring weird life decisions, and always led by a neurotic and frantic demeanor, the work of Brooks may be rather unsung nowadays, but is impossible to ignore. In Lost in America, Brooks' David Howard gets fired from his high-paying advertising job after missing out on a promotion. Convincing his wife Linda (Julie Hagerty) to quit her boring personnel director job, the two liquidate all of their assets and buy a camper to travel across America. With about $150,000 to their name, the two hope to see the country, find themselves, and finally settle in some small town on a huge lot of land that costs just $50,000 or some other cheap figure. Naturally, things wind up going very differently."", ""Lost in America is a film about the death or misuse of the American dream. Told from youth that if you are smart, go to college, and put your nose to the grindstone, you will rise to the very top of the corporate world. Unfortunately, what is neglected to be mentioned is that there are only so many chairs left and the music is just about to end. Hoping to become Senior VP, only to be transferred across the country, David is a man scorned by this dream. Linda, for her part, is stuck in a dead end job. Both have given just under a decade to their current positions and, yet, both have found there to be no more upward mobility. If they are content, they can stay in these jobs for the rest of time while rotting away on the inside. Or, if the feeling of just waiting for one's death is not appealing, they can always try to find a new job. However, they will never be able to get their present salary, position, or respectability. In essence, at a certain point, there is no more stone to grind with one's nose. Instead, there is a status quo that will remain until action is taken."", ""For David and Linda, the best option is to just drop off of the grid and travel the country. By his own admission, this is a path that David once mocked people for in his youth, but it is one he is not greatly envious of being able to accomplish. Likely a by-product of life always being greener on other side, the idea is nonetheless rather admirable. Similar to the counter work culture experience in the 20th century via films such as Fight Club, American Beauty, and Office Space, Lost in America speaks about the hollow existences experienced by those in the workforce. Get up, get dressed, go to work, come home, pass out, and then do it all over again. This robotic lifestyle has turned us all into corporate drones, merely waiting for our next promotion or opportunity to prove ourselves at work when, in reality, investing in ourselves and in our lives is far more worth our while. Rather than kissing ass at work, why not let loose and live a little for our own mental health? Yet, Brooks' film is smart. Never idealizing the lifestyle of just living on the road, Lost in America shows the perils and sore points that could arise. Loose spending and celebrating one's newly found liberation a little too much could lead to great stress and anguish in the blink of an eye. In essence, Lost in America argues for a balance. Taking time away from work to live one's life is a vital part of living that everybody should attempt. Becoming a mindless zombie who only knows how to go to work is not what the American dream is truly about, no matter what we have been taught growing up. Rather, the American dream is about the freedom to live one's life as they choose. We can never entirely drop off of the grid, as a source of income is a necessary evil in the world. Yet, that necessary evil is no reason to remain stationary and never utilize the freedom of movement. As a result, the American population have misused the American dream through misinterpretation. Believing it to be solely about how anybody can make themselves into something through hard work - implying dedication work - the American dream is truly about how anybody can live their life as they wish and by their own design. Striking a balance between what we need to do - work - and what we want to do - in the case of the film, travel and move to new locations - is where the key to truly utilizing the American dream lies. Becoming a slave to work or an unemployed drifter are perfect examples of taking a lifestyle to the extreme with that way of life feeling too restrictive and dull after a while. Blending the two together allows one to truly find a measure of happiness in a world so dictated by success in the workplace. If, as a society, we came together to realize that work-life balance - and thus, truly realizing the American dream of building a family (life) and a career (work) no matter who you are"" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

However, much like Fargo, this one is anchored by strong performances (especially Javier Bardem who was absolutely postively amazing), as well as brilliant cinematography by Roger Deakins, and great directing by the Coen Brothers. I am not a huge huge Coen Brothers fan, but their skill is undeniable and it is on full display here. In particular, the thrills and then the lack of a \""satisfying\"" ending were perfect. While many were bothered by the ending, I absolutely loved it. While it may not be what you are looking for, it feels all so appropriate. However, easily my favorite sequence is the opening sequence with the great monologue by Tommy Lee Jones, which really sets up the rest of the film perfectly. In addition, Anton's first victim that we see really sets the tone for how crazy and vicious he really is. Finally, the setting is gorgeous. I am a sucker for western settings in film and this one is no exception. It really lends itself to beautiful shot after beautiful shot and Deakins and the Coens really use it to its fullest."", """", ""On the negative side, the film is a tad slow admittedly.

Patrick Fugit, Billy Crudup, Kate Hudson, Jason Lee, and Philip Seymour Hoffman, are all stupendous. All of their characters are endearing in their own way and really steal the spotlight individually at times. The directing from Cameron Crowe is great and the story is told wonderfully. It really does not glamorize rock and roll of the time, but it certainly makes you fall in love with these flawed human beings as we interact with them through the eyes of a young 15 year old writer. We truly fall in love with these people as he does and struggle through the same struggles he does as a writer on this trip that changes his life forever. Ultimately, Almost Famous is a resounding success and a film that provides laughs, drama, and just enough of romance, to keep you interested. A truly great film."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

John Malkovich is fantastic as the bad guy and really gives you the chills. He has the right amount of hurt and insanity for the character he played and did it phenomenally. Clint Eastwood, though a little old, is very good as well. The story is intense and Wolfgang Petersen does a great job creating a ton of tension. The pace is brisk and I liked the focus on dialogue, rather than a focus on action shootouts like in many thrillers. I think the love interest element was unnecessary and just tossed in there, as it added really nothing to the film, honestly. As a whole, In the Line of Fire is a good, intense thriller that works from every angle and though formulaic, it is a great example of using a formula very successfully."" ]";0;3;0;3;0;0

Though it can be over-the-top at times, it is a fantastic time throughout that really exceeded my expectations completely. I expected it to be pretty dumb all around, but instead, I got a crazy good time that kept me laughing from beginning to end.

Yet, the man has so many hits, it is disgusting. This Is Spinal Tap, The Princess Bride, and The American President are comical riots. I often watch comedies and, in the spirit of hating fun, do not find them very funny. There are very few comedies that actually hit the right notes for me and leave me gasping for air. When Harry Met Sally joins those other Reiner films (aside from The Princess Bride, which was pretty good, but not nearly as funny) in making me laugh consistently from beginning to end. With charismatic turns from Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan, the film is oozing with chemistry, joy, and commentary on relationships. Even better, it casts aside Hollywood romance cliches in favor of a realistic approach to love and inter-sex non-sexual relationships."", ""Pairing together Harry (Billy Crystal) and Sally (Meg Ryan), the film actually takes a while to put them together. Yet, while the romance begins to take root, the pair's comedic chemistry is natural and easy to watch. With a manic, depressive, and neurotic style of comedy, Billy Crystal drops top-notch lines like they were nothing. Comedy just rolls off his tongue like butter on a pan. Alongside him is the far more stoic and proper Ryan who plays Crystal's comedic foil. Yet, make no mistake, she can be funny as well and really goes toe-to-toe with Crystal from the very beginning. Yet, what really helps to make the film funnier is the writing from Nora Ephron. With quotable lines coming from every direction, the comedic writing here is stellar with a tremendous understanding of the skills of the leads and playing to those strengths. The material Crystal and Ryan are given is within the realm of their comedic talent and charisma, allowing for free flowing joy and comedy."", ""The film's other major strength in the writing is its relationship. Resisting the temptation to throw its originally mismatched leads together, it builds up authentically. Putting them together as friends who avoid sex to ruin the friendship and then finally give in to temptation, but resist is brilliant and real. Though a classic Hollywood romantic comedy film, it does not deliver a cliche and over dramatic pay-off. Instead, it feels real. Harry and Sally could be real people who have finally pulled their heads out of their asses and saw the sky for the first time. They resist the love they feel to not lose a friend and, when they finally give in, it is clear they are a match for one another. Yet, through fear and trepidation towards losing this great friend, they still remain skeptical. For many, this is a fact of life and to see it so brilliantly portrayed on screen shows the real triumph of this film."", ""One of the main reasons why I loved When Harry Met Sally though is simply the pure, unbridled joy of watching this film. It is an easy watch, but yet a great exploration of romance and friendship. It pairs two incredibly likable leads together, puts together realistically, and does not rush anything between them. Sprinkling in real life stories of love and marriage only adds to the magic of the film. Rob Reiner knows comedy and it is really shown in this film, even though he rarely gets the credit he deserves as being a top-notch director when working with great material (mainly because his output since the late 1990s has been garbage). Here, he crafts an eminently likable film that blends romantic comedy cliches (two lovers who hate each other first being a common trope) and then adds layers of realism to the equation that largely subvert the cliches to the point that Billy Crystal running through New York to find Meg Ryan feels authentic and real. Rather than absurd, it is a bombastic, romantic, and magical gesture that encapsulates the power of love and the crazy things it can make people do. Classics always have a lot to live up to, but When Harry Met Sally exceeds all expectations with impeccable comedy, comedic frequency, writing, and romance."" ]";0;0;0;0;1;0
the-conversation;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;Jul 20, 2017;"[ ""Right when it seemed as though Francis Ford Coppola had reached the pinnacle of the cinema world in 1972 with The Godfather, he decided to mess around and release two Best Picture nominees in 1974. Though The Conversation would lose to The Godfather Part II – honestly, I wonder if Coppola wanted one to win over the other or not – it has become revered as yet another classic from Coppola in the 1970s. Add in Apocalypse Now and it is clear why he is still revered a legend of the screen, even after releasing light hits and decided misses in the years since. A masterful mystery thriller, The Conversation was a bit of a diversion from The Godfather as a shorter film, but it is styled in very much the same fashion. Slow, character-driven, and building up slowly to its crescendo, Coppola’s The Conversation may not be quite on the level of The Godfather films, but with great sound, direction, acting, and a truly engrossing plot, The Conversation certainly holds its own among the towering triumphs achieved by Francis Ford Coppola in the 1970s."", ""Starring Gene Hackman as Harry Caul, The Conversation is a mystery thriller about a man who records a mysterious conversation. That man, Harry Caul, had been hired by a mysterious third-party (Robert Duvall), known only as “the director”, to record this call. With the help of his assistant Stan (John Cazale) and others, the conversation is recorded at great pain with the involved parties seemingly avoiding such an operation by walking in a loud open area and going in circles. As time goes on – and after some close encounters with the director’s assistant (Harrison Ford) – Harry begins to believe that this recording is something much more. Will these people be killed? Are they targets of some kind? Or are they plotting something? Trying to unmask the secrets of the scenario, armed only with his recording of this one-off conversation, Harry is driven to very brink of paranoia. In many ways, The Conversation often plays as a direct influence on later works such as Brian De Palma’s Blow Out or the 2006 German film The Lives of Others. With the protagonist being a largely innocent party who happens to record something of a very sordid nature, the film finds tension in initially framing the situation as one where Harry must protect those he recorded, out of fear that they will be harmed. However, clues along the way make it entirely possible he has it reversed. Or, is he just entirely paranoid and nobody is at risk? Smartly plotted, slow, and unwilling to explain everything, The Conversation is one of those films that seems to answer its questions and reveal the secrets behind its plot, but it only leads to further questions. It is a film that really sticks with you and refuses to let go due to its incredibly strong writing and the fantastic execution of its premise."", ""It is from this uncertainty that the film really plays up Harry’s paranoia. Slowly unraveling over the course of the film, it quickly becomes clear that Harry is not entirely mentally sound. Due to past regrets over having gotten people killed because of his recordings and his own paranoia about being recorded, Harry is a man ready to unravel at any point. With his new recording possibly leading somebody to die or be killed, his old regrets bubble back up to the surface and begin to wreak havoc on his mental health. Yet, where it makes the most profound impact is in his fear of being recorded. He knows the lengths that many will go to in order to record others and snoop on them. He also knows the damage a simple soundbite can create. Thus, he is desperate to avoid this with an intense alarm system in his home and absolute secrecy with his women. While a brilliant man in his field, it does not take a genius to realize that Harry is not all there. Brilliantly capturing this, Gene Hackman turns in a very nervy and on-edge performance where Harry is constantly appearing frazzled. On his face, there is a paranoid look of wonderment as to where “they” may be hiding to spy on him, even when he is alone. Nobody can be trusted in this world driven by paranoia with Hackman’s interpretation really nailing this feeling. Coppola’s use of music and camera movement also helps greatly in the film’s final scene. Showing Harry rip out his whole home after being confronted with an actual recording of himself, the scene is intense and frighteningly frantic. With a deeply unsettling backing track and a tight camera shot that spins around the room centered on Harry, the final moments of the film feel entirely claustrophobic. The ultimate culmination of all of his worrying regarding being followed or hurting others is confronting him and backing him into a mental corner that he may never escape. Intense and thrilling, this final scene is honestly quite horrifying and shows just how damaging paranoia, even when one has nothing to hide, can be to the human brain."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

Ultimately, this one is a gangster film that does a really good job developing the characters and making them all very human. By the end, you can see why Depp's character is going through the things he is and the conflict he is facing. In addition, though you know Pacino and Madsen are bad men, you feel a ton of sympathy for them. That is a key to the success of many films and this one completely nails making us care and feel for the characters, no matter how bad of a person they may be. In addition, the development these characters go through in two hours is great and feels like a good representation of the true story behind this one. My only complaint here was the beginning, in which the development happened at the snap of a finger and seemed a little rapid and unlikely.

This is not a film watched for the plot, for the acting, or for the dialogue (seriously, if Satan arrives and one of his first actions is typing on a computer through some woman to say, \""In fact, YOU WILL NOT BE SAVED\"", I will bust a gut laughing), but rather for John Carpenter's ability to entertain audiences. Truly scary, ominous, deeply unsettling, and a film that makes you leery to investigate what just creaked downstairs, Prince of Darkness is a film with one hell of an atmosphere. Blessed by Carpenter's fantastic score, an engaging premise, and truly terrific scares, Prince of Darkness is a film that will leave you reeling once it is finished."", ""As the second entry into John Carpenter's Apocalypse trilogy with The Thing and In the Mouth of Madness, it is seemingly fitting that Prince of Darkness concerns the return of Satan to the world. However, rather than a Biblical interpretation, Carpenter has a twist on the tale. Using matter and antimatter as the basis, the world in Prince of Darkness exists in the antimatter plane of existence, with Satan existing to bring darkness in the antimatter world rather than the lightness brought by God in the matter-side. Jesus came as an extraterrestrial to warn humanity of Satan's return, all while Satan was turned into a glowing green fluid by his father (who was sent to the dark side) and buried underneath an old church. Overseen by a secret group of priests, this green liquid starts to formulate with the death of the latest guardian revealing to a Priest (Donald Pleasance) that Satan is ready to return. Teaming up with physician Professor Howard Birack (Victor Wong) and students, the group must now fight back against this being by deciphering what it is, what it is capable of, and then having to wing it to fight back in the end. In other words, this film is absolutely insane."", ""Yet, it is this insanity that makes Prince of Darkness so appealing. Playing fast and loose with logic and timelines, the only bits that are important are that this pile of green liquid is super powerful, takes over people to do its bidding, and then will slowly possess the body of one of the people to fulfill its goal of bringing its father back through a mirror portal. This all sounds like something Carpenter dreamt up, yet it all somehow works. The corny acting, the cheesy plot, and the B-movie aesthetics, are what gives the film its charm and makes it such a blast to watch. While hardly a concrete reason to love a film, as one can easily enjoy a bad film, Prince of Darkness is one those films that has such an immersive and well-thought out world that any absurdity, silly turns, or insanity is forgiven. It creates a world that is so easily dove into and enjoyed that the audience goes along with this insanity and wants to jump right back in when the film ends. It is a cinematic experience like few others, creating a world so enticing, unique, and thrilling, that it feels like cinematic cocaine. One hit of Prince of Darkness and you are hooked, begging for the film to just give you a little bit more or to simply never end."", ""While the concept of this film is absurd on the surface, it is Carpenter who breathes life into this odd script and weird collection of events and characters. Delivering a slow build-up with the one-by-one elimination of the physicists, the realization of what is happening, and the slow return of Satan just in time for the finale. Carpenter's perfect pacing allows the film to unravel at just the right pace to keep the viewer on edge and jumpy. With the surrealist dreams as a great added touch on top of this, the ominous hints about what is to come only further serve the film's tension and fantastic atmosphere that leaves you hooked to see what is coming next."", ""As with all Carpenter films, one of the film's greatest assets is undoubtedly its score. With a great synthy, ominous, and greatly creepy score, in its back pocket, Prince of Darkness sets the tone early and often with Carpenter often relying on the score alone to add tension to seemingly innocuous events. Yet, it is not the type of score that becomes overbearing or a film that becomes too reliant on its score to scare. The events depicted do that well enough. However, the score amplifies these scares and the tension, creating a terrific atmosphere that keeps on edge and makes the scares that much more effective. The audio as a whole does the same with little bumps, creaks, and other noises giving the film a great edge and bite to it that keeps audiences guessing as to what that sound was or simply creeped out as to what we just heard coming from the other room or the other side of a wall. Sound is often Carpenter's strongest asset and Prince of Darkness exemplifies why that is often the case in his films."" ]";0;0;0;0;1;0

In addition, the fight sequences were brilliantly choreographed and I also appreciate that while of course there has to be a lot of blood, it was never gratuitous. As for the acting, Russell Crowe did a really great job as Maximus, but for me, Joaquin Phoenix outshined him. Phoenix brought the consciously evil Commodus to life.

It did not help move the film forward in the least. In terms of providing character history, it works, but as the action unfolds, it no longer really serves a purpose and felt like excess. In addition, the aforementioned slow beginning sequence was not overly to my liking, though I certainly understand why it is there and cannot complain over its conclusion. It simply did not provide the necessary spark to grab the viewers attention in my mind, but regardless, its importance is clear. Other than that, while typically top-notch, the CGI at times was noticeable with some unrealistic deaths along the way, but that is to be expected, as no film is perfect."", """", ""Overall, Gladiator is a very good film that proves that these types of films can be done successfully if enough work is put into them.

The fact that much of the dialogue was ad libbed makes this one even better and really helped to make it feel so natural. Spinal Tap is obviously not a real band, but it truly felt like it was at times since the interviews and interactions felt so natural and authentic. In every way imaginable, This Is Spinal Tap is a classic comedy from the 80's that is worthy of the praise it has received over the years."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

Everybody really embodies their character thanks to great casting all around. The direction from Sam Mendes is great and it is amazing to think that this was his debut. The script is very good. It is witty and dark at the same time. It is hard to place my finger on what the film is about. It is not overly complex, but there are so many things that are going on, that you cannot really say what this one is about in a sentence without leaving out a ton of information. But, I will try. Ultimately, to me, American Beauty is about life and the facade's we all put up around our lives to project an image of what we want we to be, rather than what we truly are. However, even in saying that, it leaves you a lot of the topics discussed, such as self-liberation, sexuality, and love. Yet, I think my simplistic sentence briefly covers all of those to some degree, as they all deal with pretending things are not what they are. In addition, I really love the title. There are so many different meanings behind \""American Beauty\"", whether it be the roses that are shown throughout the film, Mena Suvari's character, the beauty of the American Dream, or many other things. The film is not overly complicated, but has so many different plausible interpretations that it a fun film to dissect. American Beauty is a truly great work that is fun to watch and fun to discuss thanks to great acting, direction, and writing."" ]";0;0;0;0;1;0

repo-man;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;Aug 25, 2017;"[ ""Born out of the counter-culture revolution, Alex Cox's Repo Man is a cynical, madcap, and absolutely absurd critique of the world of 1984 made by a man who had very little he liked and a very nihilistic view of the world around him. Set in small town California with young rebel Otto (Emilio Estevez) unwittingly having to remove his oversized earrings to become a repo man alongside Bud (Harry Dean Stanton), Repo Man is the kind of cultural critique that hits every possible area of American life to the point that it becomes a bit much. Fortunately, Repo Man's frantic pace, wacky plot, and delightfully odd characters, make it a film that as hard to resist as being offered by speed by a middle aged repo man as you cruise around town talking being repo men. Honestly, no film may better sum up 1980s cinema than Repo Man. Goofy effects, douchey young adults, Harry Dean Stanton, inventive ideas, and an anti-consumerist undercurrent running throughout the film."", ""Using the repo man profession as an entry into this wacky science fiction comedy, Repo Man is interesting in how little it actually focuses on science fiction. Aside from a few mentions of aliens or the possibility of getting a Chevy Malibu as a repo (which is the car carrying those aliens), much of this film is just Otto, Bud, and Lite (Sy Richardson) picking up cars. As a result, Cox is able to mock and criticize the consumerist culture we have in America. With people constantly pissed off at the fact their car is being taken even though it is their fault, Repo Man sets the tone by showing just how dumb people can really be. The poor buy cars they cannot afford or need. The rich buy cars and feel superior to having to pay them. To Cox, both of these sides are idiotic and those who get upset about losing their car in a repo deserve to get their ass whooped by a gang of repo men with bats. Yet, the reason is not because of capitalist ideology or anything of the like. Instead, it is based upon one's word. As Bud states, credit is the only thing in this world that really matters. It separates us from the communists, yes, and Cox clearly does not like communism as he openly mocks it and the idea of things being \""free\"", but the obligation to pay in the mind of Repo Man is not out of making the economy work. Rather, it is because somebody gave you money to buy something, thus you must pay them back. Credit shows how trustworthy a person is to return that money and, to the film, that defines a person's character. Somebody with bad credit is a bad person and vice versa. By not having credit as a way to determine somebody's trustworthiness, it makes communism inherently bad."", ""That said, in true nihilistic fashion, Cox hardly appreciates capitalism either. Critiquing the hustling televangelist who has Otto's parents in a trance and demands thousands of dollars in the name of God or by simply having Otto lament about television shows where people just consume, consume, and consume, Repo Man is a film that rails against consumerism and, by extension, capitalism. Showing the stress on society of a culture defined by what you have, the film shows the lengths people have resorted to as a result. With people not paying their cars, engaging in carjacking, or shooting people over repossessing their car, this car becomes an extension of who they are and how they define themselves, making it a personal affront to take it or to put obstacles in the way of them owning the car. This blase attitude to purchasing, in spite of consumerism, is really exemplified in the group of kids who go around engaging in robberies. Robbing the same store repeatedly, stealing the Chevy Malibu, and constantly questioning authority, the group is morally opposed to buying things, lest they appear poor. By stealing, they still get to identify themselves as members of this capitalist society and, by extension, as adults."", ""To a comedic degree, Repo Man consistently demonstrates just how immature these characters are by simply showing their interactions with one another. With criminals Duke (Dick Rude) and Debbi (Jennifer Balgobin) robbing stores, the two seem to really gel only when committing crimes. In one line, Duke demonstrates his maturity level by looking at Debbi and saying, \""Let's go get sushi and not pay.\"" Juvenile and a child's definition of living life on the edge and not paying, these robberies clearly make him and Debbi feel like adults. It gives them some control and a semblance of an adult life in spite of their childish surroundings and behavior. Underscoring these actions as ones from a wannabe adult, Cox shows Duke asking Debbi to \""have my baby\"" with the reasoning that it is what people seem to do from what he has noticed. These are lost kids, trying to find meaning in a world without any. By the time they are adults, the television-obsessed and consumerist adults have demonstrated two things has being marks of adulthood: having things and having kids. Who can blame these kids"" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

Much like Airplane, the pace is very very fast, especially when it comes to jokes, which leaves you laughing continously and having to pause the movie to stop laughing and catch your breath briefly. The great part about a comedy like this is that the plot is irrelevant. They try to establish one, of course, but really, it does not matter.

magnolia;9;Spangle;/user/Spangle;Aug 23, 2014;"[ ""Who would guess that a film like this would be successful? However, it absolutely is. Magnolia explores the themes of loneliness, regret, forgiveness, the past, and parent-child relationships, with snapshots of the life of a group of broken and troubled people who are all linked, even if they do not know it. Thanks to great acting from the ensemble cast featuring Tom Cruise, Melinda Dillon, Jeremy Blackman, Philip Baker Hall, Philip Seymour Hoffman, William H. Macy, Julianne Moore, John C. Reilly, Jason Robards, and Melora Walters, Magnolia's diverse (yet not as diverse as you may think) are brought to life brilliantly. It also does not hurt that the writing is superb and the depth we go to with these characters in just three hours is amazing. On that note, this one comes in at three hours and in spite of it, it feels like it was nothing more than an hour and a half, as the runtime just flies by. The ending is incredibly odd, though it brings the biblical references and the freak happenings of this one to conclusion nicely, as odd as it may truly be. Overall, Magnolia is a beautiful and brilliantly made film that will move and entertain you."" ]";1;2;1;1;1;0
edward-scissorhands;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;Jul 15, 2016;"[ ""From the wild and wacky mind of Tim Burton comes Edward Scissorhands, a tragic and charming look at a man with scissors for hands. A film that only Burton could make, his direction is as sound as usual and he manages to evoke considerable sympathy for this tragic figure who is, otherwise, a normal man but cursed to live his days with scissors as hands. Johnny Depp does a great job bringing this man to life and brings a certain tenderness and has fantastic chemistry with Winona Ryder when it comes to the romantic element of the film. The writing is incredibly strong and, together with Burton's direction, keeps this one reined in and keeps it from getting out of control when it easily could have with such a crazy premise. The characters are well developed and truly multi-dimensional. Edward Scissorhands' portrayal of suburban life also feels delightfully and quintessentially late 80s, early 90s and really serves as a perfect backdrop for the introduction of such a weird and unique person. Though I may be one of the few to have never seen Edward Scissorhands, it is truly timeless and will live on for a long, long time due to its fairy tale and thematic elements that really are universal and its ability to be both unique, yet incredibly stirring, tragic, and moving. This one is Tim Burton at his very finest."" ]";0;1;0;1;0;0

This one is an interesting mix of genres, all of which are used very well. In addition, the film is just very inspirational. At times, it can teeter to being a bit too cheesy, but the most part, everything here is clicking. This one is very moving at times and Washington does a great job playing the sympathetic character and really makes you feel horrible for the situation he found himself in. Now, the film does not appear to be an overly accurate portrayal of facts, but as it is a film, that is too be expected. The only thing that really stuck out that bothered me was there were some things that were odd, namely connections between events that were never made. There are not many of these, but they are crucial enough to be worth mentioning. In spite of that, however, The Hurricane is a very well made and brilliantly acted film that will undoubtedly move you."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

Tom Hanks, David Morse, Michael Clarke Duncan, Doug Hutchison, Barry Pepper, Sam Rockwell, Michael Jeter, and James Cromwell, make up one hell of an ensemble cast for this one and all truly knock their roles out of the park. I am typically not a huge fan of prison dramas, but the heart and compassion you feel for everyone involved in amazing and truly draws you in. The more fantastical elements are also very interesting and set against the backdrop of a very realistic situation are all the more odd, but I think they are handled very well. As a whole, this one is very intriguing, touching, and unique, which elevate it above many prison dramas. Add in the great acting and you truly have something special with The Green Mile."" ]";1;1;1;0;1;0

Tim Allen, Sigourney Weaver, Alan Rickman, Tony Shalhoub, Sam Rockwell, and Justin Long, are all very good here and turn in equally hysterical performances. From beginning to end, Galaxy Quest is incredibly funny poking fun not only at the genre, but also at acting, fan bases, and Hollywood as a whole. Even better, it is not necessary to watch the films it spoofs here because the themes and jokes are easily accessible regardless.

The chemistry between Paul Newman and Robert Redford is infectious as one picks up right where the other left off the entire film. It was also unexpectedly quite funny, as the one liners were just priceless and show why the screenplay has received so much praise and why it deserves all of that praise. As with most of these classic westerns, the cinematography and set pieces were phenomenal and in this one, the action sequences were great and incredibly intense. The chase sequences were also great and I love how we are kept in the dark as to who is following them, just as they do not know. While I loved this, there were some definite negatives. First of all, there was no real plot, other than focusing on the exploits of Butch and Sundance, though it does not really go anywhere. Not a major complaint, but a complaint nonetheless. Another small complaint would be the pacing, as at times it got a tad too slow, but throughout much of the film, the slow pace was never that much of a problem. My main complaint would be Katharine Ross. Her acting here, in my opinion, was just flat out bad. I never really bought into her character and she was severely outclassed by her two legendary castmates."" ]";2;2;2;0;0;0
the-last-temptation-of-christ;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;Mar  1, 2016;"[ ""The Last Temptation of Christ is an awkward film for me. I think it is a brilliant depiction of the battle between the spirit and flesh that takes place within believers, as alluded to in the opening quote of the film. Thus, the film is very good. It accomplishes this goal with precise skill thanks to Martin Scorsese's skill as a director and Willem Dafoe as an actor. Together they craft this image of a man tortured by the feeling that God wants something from him that he does not want to give. Rather, he wants to be a normal human man, but eventually, he realizes he truly just wants God. For this, The Last Temptation of Christ is brilliant. Where it becomes awkward for me is that this is a film about Jesus Christ. I do not know if this is a great depiction of Jesus in this sense. All that makes him a great depiction of humanity makes him a bad divine depiction. Thus, I am divided in this sense, much like Jesus is often believed to be. From a technical standpoint though, the portrayal and dedication to such is fantastic. Scorsese crafts this really human Jesus who really has the same temptations as everyone else (\""Son of Man\"") and really makes the character's religious struggles incredibly relatable. While watching the film, I was incredibly mixed as I watched the film, especially with the odd dream sequences for the temptations and odd depictions of the divine, but when I saw what the film was going for at the end, I gained an appreciation for it that lacked while I watched it. Thus, I really liked The Last Temptation of Christ. It is not a film you can watch pieces of. as without the full picture, you will be lost. Scorsese's direction is masterful as always and Willem Dafoe is phenomenal as Jesus. Overall, the film is a brilliant technical work and phenomenal character study."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

While the things in this film are certainly not something to be worshipped or thought highly of, the film takes these wrong and evil acts and truly makes a beautiful film out of it. On the surface, it is about two men who makes a club where they just beat the crap out of one another, but it is really about so much more than that and it is cool to see them use that fight club as a cover for what the film is truly about. David Fincher's vision for this one is a great one and he directs this film brilliantly. In addition, the set pieces are perfect for the film and all look incredibly well done and appropriate for the film.

In others, it merely odd and tries to find new ways to out-odd itself. Yet, I cannot help but feel that I truly loved this film. From beginning to end, it is hysterical and its unique concept is accurately explored. Even better, it leads to so many questions about existence, free-will, the self, and many other postmodern ideas. One thing is for sure though: Being John Malkovich is wonderfully written. With great characters and incredible execution of such a weird idea, this one shows why Charlie Kaufman should be revered as one of the best living screenwriters. His wonderfully odd imagination plays out in his films and this one is no exception. The acting is fantastic, especially John Cusack, Catherine Keener, and John Malkovich.

This is very much the case in Blue Velvet, especially in scenes with Dennis Hopper, who is incredible here in an entirely unhinged performance. Kyle MacLachlan, Isabella Rossellini, and Laura Dern, are also all really good. Honestly, though this one is weird, I found it to be one of the more straight forward David Lynch films. Sure, there is a lot beneath the surface here that I cannot even begin to understand, but unlike in his other works I have seen, there is a plotline I can follow and understand without having to dive too deep to derive meaning here, which I liked. Though, this one certainly could be a fun one to analyze upon further viewings. Incredibly symbolic (robins, anyone?), Blue Velvet is a brilliantly written and directed piece of work that is incredibly unsettling, but entirely gripping throughout."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

showgirls;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;Jan 23, 2017;"[ ""Cited by some as one of the worst films of all-time, Showgirls' reputation has improved markedly in the past few years. From being accepted to \""so bad it's good\"" to a \""guilty pleasure\"", the film has now received a critical re-evaluation. Many critics and directors have come out and defended the film as a brilliant work of satire, which it most certainly is. Famed critic Jonathan Rosenbaum has praised it as an allegory for selling out in Hollywood. While it most certainly could be an allegory and is a satire, I believe that Showgirls is most closely aligned with a critique of the sex industry. Showing girls selling their bodies as hookers, strippers, and showgirls in seedy Vegas hotels, Showgirls is a full bodied critique of the sex industry. Derided as misogynistic and exploitative trash, Showgirls is certainly both of those, but it has to be in order to show the dark repercussions of the industry."", ""As an erotic drama, the film was criticized for not being erotic enough. Yet, that is entirely the point. The film starts off somewhat erotic, but by the end, we see the dark rewards reaped by eroticism and the warped perception of women that men have. As these women snap off their tops without prodding, men walk away with the belief that they own and possess the female body. It is their personal playground to do whatever they like. Men such as Andrew Carver (William Shockley) emphasize this with him raping a girl towards the end of the film. He could have had sex with her anyways. She was definitely going to, but he likes the power that comes with ownership. He feels as though he owns women and is unwilling to cede this control. By letting her make a consensual decision to sleep with him, he concedes that she is his equal and well, in the world of the sex industry, that is simply not allowed. Women exist solely for our entertainment and to reveal their breasts while dancing is their only contribution to society. Dark, exploitative, and unflinching in this depiction, Verhoeven shows the horrors that the sex industry breathes. It feeds into the rape culture that plagues our nation and asserts that, yes, women are nothing but male playthings."", ""However, it can become even more horrifying. The protagonist, Nomi Malone (Elizabeth Berkley), meets a man named James Smith (Glenn Plummer) early in the film. James is hardly a good guy and definitely exploits women sexually throughout the film. Yet, he does hit the nail on the head in one conversation with Nomi. He argues that places like strip clubs are alright, because they do not lie to you. The women are selling their bodies and the men are buying. It is erotic dances in a Vegas hotel, such as the show \""Goddess\"" that Nomi wants to be in, that are bad. They pretend they are art and the patrons pretend they want art, but instead they give you the women's bodies anyways. It is lying and still just as exploitative. This is certainly true of the shows at the Stardust Hotel, in which the show solely consists of women ripping off their tops and dancing half-naked. This parallel is revealed by Zack (Kyle MacLachlan) when he reveals Nomi's past. A former hooker who only cost $50-$100 a pop, Zack tells her that she has low self-esteem and sells herself short. Yet, hooking is still very much her job, she just does not have sex with patrons anymore. From stripping at the Cheetah to dancing at the Stardust, the save product is for sale: her body. The only difference is that the line of work she does now is legal. The show also shows itself to be exploitative with the girls being propositioned for sex by workers at the hotel to satisfy important customers and famed Vegas showgirl Crystal Connors (Gina Gershon) being dumped to the curve after an injury. Once they are done with you, they will throw you without hesitation. But, it is almost preferable to when they do want you, as they treat you as a sub-human sex toy."", ""The film cements itself as a critique and satire of the sex industry with a sign outside of James' apartment. Reading \""Jesus is Coming Soon\"", this simple sign is a call for help from the sex industry. Having seen Sodom and Gomorrah destroyed for the same antics as those found in Las Vegas, it is a warning to heed the word of the Bible before it is too late. Exploiting women's bodies for over-stimulation and titillation is putting the city and the people in a hand basket destined for Hell. This also drives at why the film is not supposed to be erotic, but rather exploitative. Verhoeven rips open blouses repeatedly to show you the horror of the situation these girls find themselves in. Though they may be smart or talented, their only value is their breasts and there seems to be solemn knowledge of this fact possessed by the women. Yet, this knowledge is juxtaposed by an urgent warning to shape up and repent as Jesus will soon arrive and Vegas will most certainly be left behind."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

There are numerous scenes here that manage to do all three, but above all, I found this film to be incredibly moving. A study of ghosts (and what they want), as well as the mind of troubled children, The Sixth Sense manages to really move its audience in a truly unexpected way. I did not expect to be practically moved to tears by this one, but there I was, fighting back tears towards the end. Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osment, and Toni Collette, are all great here, especially Osment who really shows how talented of an actor he is.

Naturally, in line with this, my expectation was to see a lot more sex than I actually got. Now, none of these are bad things, in fact rather good. By not meeting these expectations, Midnight Cowboy manages to actually tell a far more interesting story of a young, hurt Texan boy coming to New York City to try to become a prostitute and meeting an ill loser with a limp who becomes his best friend. As a startling counter-point to the American dream at the height of the Vietnam War, Midnight Cowboy is a very good character study and a pure technical showcase for director John Schlesinger."", ""With this young Texan cowboy Joe Buck (Jon Voight), Midnight Cowboy creates the quintessential American male. Name dropping Gary Cooper or John Wayne as similar ideals of what a man is supposed to be, it is only natural that in the counter-culture 1960s, Schlesinger would take this example of masculinity and throw him into situations unfit for men. Sleeping with women as a prostitute or even partaking with some men when times are hard, as well as going to seedy underground parties with drugs, Joe Buck seems to be a man who could not be further from the old school definition of masculinity even if his look and style of dress say otherwise. Compounding this, he steals readily. Inspired by friend Enrico \""Ratso\"" Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman), Buck begins to rob people or steal small items to attempt to get any small number of funds for the two of them, Buck flies in the face of classic cowboy western stars Cooper and Wayne. Known for playing Sheriffs or simply passer-bys who fight against men who steal land/cattle from others, Cooper and Wayne are strictly on the \""right\"" side of morality. Buck, however, by trading in sex and stealing stands as the complete foil to those classic men, to the degree that he would be an appropriate antagonist in one of their films. Schlesinger certainly hints at this dark villainy by the film's title of Midnight Cowboy. Dark and ominous, the addition of \""Midnight\"" makes it read as being the darker version of a cowboy and, as it plays out, it is very appropriate."", ""In the process, Midnight Cowboy stands as a critique of the American dream. With a small town boy coming to the big city on a bus ride that takes him through quintessential American items - commercial billboards, oil, diners, etc. - the film presents Americana and then shows the polar opposite: the dark underbelly. Showing how this unassuming and innocent boy is quickly corrupted and spit out by the big city, the film shows Joe's journey from renting a small hotel room to being kicked out and having to stay in a condemned building with Ratso. Going from the penthouse in which he spends an afternoon with a rich cougar to the literal sewer with a man nicknamed rat, Joe goes from king of the hill to bottom of the heap in no time whatsoever. As easily as he walked in, New York City and its high barriers to entry spit him out into the gutter with drug-infested parties, dirty homes, and grime around every corner. On the surface, for men such as Joe or others who journey to the big city to achieve their dreams, it all seems so easy. Once they arrive, however, the city and its machinations put up barriers all around that make \""making it\"" a challenge few can accomplish. Unfortunately for Joe, he is not one of those and, as a result, he must live in what can only be defined as \""squalor\"" on a good day."", ""To capture the horrors seen by Joe - even if he does not believe them to be horrors - Schlesinger uses hectic and pretty nifty camera work throughout. Constantly cutting with jarring flashbacks revealing Joe's horrifying past in Texas with his unstable girlfriend, Midnight Cowboy can really only be described as a kaleidoscopic descent into the madness of this grimy and dark world of sin that he has found himself trapped within. Yet, perhaps most interesting is the party sequence. Using what is best described as a picture-in-picture approach at times, Schlesinger shows a shrunken version of the shot in the middle of the screen with the blown up, out-of-focus version of that shot playing in the background. It is deeply unsettling, off-putting, and greatly unique to watch. It really captures the mind-altering and vision-altering impact of drugs and makes what is already a deeply unsettling sequence to watch feel even grimier and more distorted."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0
fast-times-at-ridgemont-high;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;Nov 30, 2016;"[ ""Sex, drugs, and rock & roll define Fast Times at Ridgemont High which highlights sex-obsessed, druggy, Van Halen fans. A classic of 1980s teen comedy, director Amy Heckerling manages to craft a terrific teen film in her directorial debut. Given her later struggles as a director, aside from Clueless, it is clear she is most adept when handling female protagonists. Fast Times at Ridgemont High really highlights this with some truly terrific females characters, as well as some good supporting male characters. All-in-all, the film is a funny, authentic, and loose look at teenagers in the 1980s and, really, any decade. With good performances all around, Fast Times at Ridgemont High remains a classic of the coming of age genre."", ""Featuring an ensemble cast led by Jennifer Jason Leigh as Stacy Hamilton (kind of), Fast Times at Ridgemont High's greatest accomplishment is its authentic characters. Coaxed into believing sex is all that matters, Stacy begins toying around with the idea until an abortion, Stacy is the typical high school girl. Immature and unsure of what she wants, she assumes she wants what her closest friend claims to want as well. That is until she meets Mark Ratner (Brian Backer). Hilariously awkward, Mark is really my spirit animal. In particular, the scene where he is about to close the deal with Stacy after their first date and they wind up looking at a photo album instead. This moment, though it has never happened to me, really spoke to me on a personal level. Mark is awkward, yet a good person. Though Stacy first overlooks him even though she does find him attractive, she comes to see how great he could be. This is not a classic \""nice guy\"" scenario where he is just nice to her in the hopes she will begin to look him. Rather, there is a mutual attraction from the beginning, highlighting just how well-written these characters are, even for 1982. This is not a classic creepy Hollywood romance. Instead, it is authentic and realistic."", ""Stacy's best friend Linda Barrett (Phoebe Cates) is equally well-written. Nailing the girl who believes she is wise beyond her years, Linda acts as though she is a sexual professional while speaking about her mysterious fiance in Chicago. Along the way, she convinces Stacy to think the same way that she does. In reality, odds are that Linda does not actually have sex with anybody, even if she does believe herself to be a mature adult. There is always one of these kind of people in high school and Linda really embodies this personality. On the flip side, we have Mike Damone (Robert Romanus) who believes himself to be a ladies man. In reality, he is incredibly inexperienced and does not know what to do at all when it comes to women. Similarly to Linda, Mike believes himself to be incredibly mature, even if he still has a lot of growing up to do."", ""These are just tidbits of the terrific characters in the film who are all incredibly authentic, while also very well acted. In particular, Sean Penn shines as Jeff Spicoli, the stoned slacker. Always disconnected, confused, and stoned, Penn really nails the character and how laid back the \""druggy\"" of the school always ends up being. Really, the way in which the film manages to develop its wide array of characters and make them all incredibly authentic is very impressive. As one watches the film, there are numerous moments where you can sit back and point to people these characters remind you of. This is really Heckerling and writer Cameron Crowe's greatest accomplishment here: authenticity. With some teenage coming of age movie cliches under its belt, the film manages to overcome them with great authenticity."", ""Largely a stream of consciousness style film, Fast Times at Ridgemont High is a very funny, incredibly realistic, and fast paced coming of age film. With good performances all around, the film is both incredibly enjoyable and insightful as to the obsession with sex possessed by high school students."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

Instead, I get a beautiful film that examines divisions, parental relationships, and the complexity of the individual. Incredibly written and directed by John Sayles, Lone Star is poetry in motion with numerous intertwining subplots that all connect and unite at one point: the death of the old sheriff. This death reveals many things and leads to changes for the town residents who must solve the mysteries of the past to fix themselves. With a terrific leading performance from Chris Cooper, the film has an incredibly strong supporting cast that really add to the feel of this Texas border town. Lone Star is so poetic and cinematic that even its setting reveals more of the film's thematic elements and really plays into what the film is attempting to communicate.

the-mosquito-coast;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;Feb 25, 2017;"[ ""The Mosquito Coast is a very unique film. Maybe not unique for director Peter Weir, who is known for his slow and contemplative dramas, but definitely unique for star Harrison Ford. No action, no fight scenes, and no archaeological digs. This is a straight drama and Ford was rewarded by it being the only film he starred in to lose money. Playing eccentric inventor Allie Fox, The Mosquito Coast depicts Allie taking his family to Belize where he buys a small village. Fed up with American life and the perceived failure of it as a society, he sees the small village of Jeronimo as a paradise where they can start over. Unfortunately, things go haywire as he gets more-and-more erratic in his behavior. A slow descent into madness, Ford turns in possibly his best acting performance in the film and it is a film with various thematic layers courtesy of Weir."", ""One of the most readily apparent themes at play in the film is the perceived failure of the American dream. Winding down to the point where people buy things they do not need and sells things to people who also do not need them, commercialization has superseded ambition. Driving past migrant workers in America, Fox laments to his two sons - Charlie (River Phoenix) and Jerry (Jadrien Steele) - that he has no idea why they keep coming here. They work their asses off and for what? Nothing but abject poverty. Constantly complaining about the way in which America has spiraled downward into being practically a parody of itself, Allie Fox is a man who eventually proves just how hard it is to build a society. In Jeronimo, he builds his ice machine that produces ice from fire and provides preservation for food and air conditioning, but his greed and pride lead him to abusing his machine to kill intruders. Backfiring, he winds up quickly destroying his settlement. Viewed in comparison with the theme of the failed American dream, Fox essentially answers his own question. He works hard to build himself up with no expectation of monetary reward. He does it because he has to and he views this place as his best chance for happiness. For immigrants, their reasons are very much the same. Unfortunately, infrastructure of the country they arrive in winds up blowing up in their face and knocking them back down to square one."", ""Early in the film, Allie also rants about the world. Stating that war has changed immeasurably, he believes that no longer is either side entirely innocent in war. Rather, both sides are different shades of evil. This belief comes to fruition when he battles Reverend Spellgood (Andre Gregory). Bringing Christianity to the area via his missionary, he and Allie do battle and the Reverend accuses Allie of being a communist. Bringing Allie's villagers to his settlement and unafraid to use a gun and kill people, the Reverend is hardly a good man. His own daughter, who befriends Charlie, hardly even likes him. Yet, Allie himself is a murderer and a dangerous psychopath. For both, they felt the call to come out to this area in Belize - the Reverend because of God and Allie because of his rejection of American society - yet they quickly discover there is not enough room for the both of them. Mirroring war, they both quickly divide their settlements and stay the hell away from one another and neither are particularly good people with both exacting violence on one another and their settlements."", ""As is clear, communism, the red scare, and nuclear holocaust also play a key thematic role in the film. Accused of being a communist, Allie also tells his children that America was destroyed by a nuclear bomb after previously warning that nuclear holocaust was on its way. In the mid-1980s, the red scare may not have been nearly as prevalent as in the 1950s, but it certainly was still around and Allie plays on this paranoia with his own children. Unfortunately for him, he brings nuclear holocaust to Jeronimo with his inventions that pollute the water. The end result being that it is not machines or the warheads we need to be wary of, but the people in control of them. His machine would not have exploded had he not used it for his own nefarious purposes out of greed, pride, and anger. In essence, he was the reason for hellfire coming to his settlement and opened himself up to punishment for his own inclination to fall into excess. Similarly, nuclear holocaust would not be a fear if it were not for the people willing to use them for nefarious purposes. Nuclear energy could be used for good just as his machine could be used for good, but its purpose is perverted and used to promote various agendas or criminal enterprises."", ""Thematically important, The Mosquito Coast may be too slow for some, but it is undeniably riveting to watch unfold. Thrilling, dramatic, and horrifying, Allie Fox's descent into pure insanity and into a dangerous man is hard to watch and a compelling character study of a man who subtly becomes the evil he was warning his kids about in the beginning."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

The end result is a funny and truly witty film with terrific acting and writing."", """", ""Led by William Hurt in the acting department, Hurt's Tom Grunick is a moron. Yet, he is charismatic and knows how to read the news well. Thus, he rises quickly within the news world and women trip over themselves to meet him. Grunick, however, is clueless as to what causes his success and has no idea what he is doing minute-by-minute. Hurt expertly captures this aloof quality of the character and it is the basis on which his entire performance is based. In every moment of his life, Grunick is lost and a mere look at Hurt's face clues you into the degree of his confusion. This is why his performance is so good."", """", ""As producer Jane Craig, Holly Hunter is also tremendous, however. The exact opposite of Grunick, Jane is the smartest person in the room. She knows it and expects everyone else to know it, yet she finds it burdensome that she can be so overbearing to those around her. There is also a significant chip on her shoulder for being a woman in a man's world, which certainly shows. Through Jane, writer/director James L. Brooks explores what it is like for a woman entering this scenario and Hunter really brings her to life. At every turn, she feels as though she is being challenged or tested by those around her and the end result is a certain neurosis she appears to be plagued by. It is as if she is about have a mental breakdown due to the chaos she attracts due to her demeanor. Hunter does a great job balancing the brilliance of Jane with her challenge to fit into this unknown world."", """", ""Albert Brooks is also quite good, though often upstaged here. Yet, he really shines through in one scene with Jane in which he expresses his feelings for her. Here, Brooks reveals the true nature of his character, Aaron Altman. Always the smartest in the room as well, Altman is unlike Jane in that he never fulfilled his potential. He was book smart, but not street smart. As the opening shows, he has always said the wrong thing at the wrong time, no matter how old he was. He certainly expects the world to cater to him and he is not afraid to show it, even when it comes to Jane. Yet, his brilliance is clear and he is very talented at his job. Brooks does a great job at making the character truly funny at times, especially with his delivery. At the same time, he balances this terrifically with his superiority complex at work and inferiority complex in love."", """", ""The romance here is also incredibly well developed, even if there is no pay-off, which is fine. Though the characters have incredible chemistry, the film would have been disingenuous if it had that big pay-off at the end of every romantic film. Tom Grunick is a jerk. Aaron Altman is a jerk. Jane is better off on her own without either of them and James L. Brooks is not afraid to end his film in this fashion, which certainly takes a lot of guts in the world of film. However, much like her approach to journalism, Jane must stay true to herself and not compromise her own values for the sake of somebody else. This shines through and even if it feels unsatisfying because we have been trained to expect a certain thing from romances, it is the correct ending for the film."", """", ""Funny and full of criticism of the news media, Broadcast News is a terrifyingly true film, both in its criticism of the journalists in this country and of romance."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

A fun and entertaining film, Robocop works on both a pure entertainment level and the satirical level, similar to Verhoeven's later work on Starship Troopers. In Robocop, Verhoeven uses its relatively straight forward plot as a tool to critique American culture, namely when it comes to violence, television, the military, capitalism, and the very infrastructure of our society. In addition, I also really thought Verhoeven was ahead of his time in his portrayal of women here, as they are shown as being largely on the same playing field as men and if you did not know better, you would have no idea what gender they are. Somehow, this film was criticized for being sexist, but I have no idea how. As I watched, I was struck by how well done the women in the film were, but I guess maybe I am the one who is wrong.

Fortunately, it was not and instead of just being tolerable, it was enthralling. The film does a great job setting up the stakes and creating incredibly interesting human beings who feel so real that, ignoring the camera, feel like people you know. The found footage element only adds to this as it really puts you into the scenes and makes you feel as if you are experiencing these events first hand.

It is heart warmingly funny and Roberto Benigni has an absolutely irresistible charm that almost distracts the viewer from the horror they are watching. The romantic element is touching and brilliantly executed (it also has the best non-sex sex scene, I've seen). Finally, the tragedy is hard-hitting. This film will truly break your heart and those last 20 minutes are guaranteed to at least leave you on the brink of tears. As a whole, Life Is Beautiful is a wonderful film that differs from other Holocaust films in that it brings some a different human element to the table, other than despair.

A character driven film, The Thin Red Line relies upon love, brotherhood, and other true human feelings and emotions rather than blood and carnage to tell the tale of its many characters.

She does all of these while being the middle child upstaged by her bratty and selfish younger sister and bullied by her older brother. Her life is not easy and she is ill-equipped to handle it, being as she is incredibly awkward and timid. The ensuing film is cringy and relies upon this black comedy awkward humor that really only accentuates the awkward nature of our lead character. Yet, in doing so, director Todd Solondz creates an incredibly relatable and sympathetic character that exists in a film so real, so authentic, and so intimate, it is hard to look away."", ""The crowning achievement of this film is the writing.

Dawn really emphasizes this when betraying her younger sister, rebuking her mother, or running off. She is unhappy in this world and in her suburban lifestyle where she is overlooked by her parents and rejected by her siblings. At school, she is mocked with her locker being vandalized on the front and her being constantly called **** or \""wiener dog\"" (also the title of Solondz's 2016 feature...).

A tough, hard-nosed, and old school gangster, he is having panic attacks stemming from a threat to his life that brings back memories of his father's murder. In a funny and witty comedy, the film pairs the comedic talents of Crystal with the tough guy nature of De Niro resulting in a perfect setup of comedic foils. Thanks to fun writing from Harold Ramis and Kenneth Lonergan, the film may not be serious, but it makes the most of its premise and really works well. It may be thin and referential to gangster movies, but the film entertains and makes you laugh for the entire runtime."", ""With irresistible chemistry, Crystal plays the man entrusted to break through the tough guy facade of Paul Vitti. Unfortunately, it comes at the time when he is set to be married to Laura (Lisa Kudrow) in Florida. With Paul following him from New York, he is forced to try and work his magic to figure out what ails this man. Suffering from panic attacks and fits of crying, Vitti is risking being killed due to this weakness. He can hear the footsteps and keeps sending his friend Jelly (Joe Vierelli) to go find the doc, regardless of what stage of getting married he finds himself in. Even worse, gangster Primo Sindone (Chazz Palminteri) wants Paul dead and the mafia, once they find out about the psychiatrist, want Ben dead. What ensues is a pretty predictable and run-of-the-mill comedy that finds humor out of making a gangster soft and a psychiatrist into a gun toting tough guy. Yet, it works."", ""Crystal and De Niro's chemistry is what sells this one as Crystal smart, witty, and mouthy comedic style really works in this film. De Niro is equally good in his role as a remorseful gangster that does not want to leave his son without a father or see him follow a life as a gangster. Yet, the film does exist on a higher plain to a degree as it examines and breaks down the tough guy facade. In reality, it is merely a copping mechanism to shelter their fragile psyches from being hurt. Or, they are just psycho. The latter obviously being far more dangerous. In the case of Paul Vitti, he just acts out of anger and desperation after being left to fend for himself after his father is killed. Thus, though the film is simply straight forward fun, Ramis and Lonergan manage to make the film have a little more depth in this area. In this blending of their two worlds, the two men are able to learn from one another. Ben Sobel learns to stand up for himself and not take abuse. Paul Vitti learns that being emotional and expressing your feelings does not make you weak. For a silly comedy that is just a twist on the buddy comedy formula, it does provide very well-written characters with solid, well-defined arcs and with purposeful actions in this film."", ""Honestly, however, there is not much to say about this one. Even what I have written is a bit of a stretch. Bottom line: Analyze This is hysterical. Billy Crystal is Billy Crystal and De Niro turns in one of his funnier performances of his late comedy-focused period.

The film is very well-written and knows what it does well and keeps the jokes coming throughout the film. Overall, King Arthur's quest for the Holy Grail is a riot."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0
mighty-aphrodite;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;Jan 27, 2017;"[ ""A modern update on Pygmalion starring a hooker with a heart of gold, Mighty Aphrodite is an absolutely hysterical film by director Woody Allen. Blending social commentary with neurosis, Mighty Aphrodite is a play on the Greek tragedies and amended for Allen's style and wit. The end result is a film that references various Greek tragedies throughout and manages to subvert the expectations of its genre, in spite of repeated warnings from the chorus. Inventive, imaginative, quirky, and witty, Mighty Aphrodite is a film that is decidedly Woody Allen, but feels risky and far more adventurous than many of his other more modern films. With a classic turn from the oddball filmmaker and from Mira Sorvino, Mighty Aphrodite is an incredibly charming film."", ""The best part of this film is undoubtedly the chorus. Led by F. Murray Abraham, the chorus is a source of great comedy from interactions with Lenny Weinrib (Woody Allen) to calling Zeus and getting his answering machine, the chorus is hysterical. However, as with all Greek tragedies, they play a key role. They tell of events off-screen, alert us to issues the characters face, and intervene throughout. F. Murray Abraham pops up throughout the film to urge Lenny to not be an idiot or give him advice on how to handle a situation. But, above all, the chorus is there is warn characters about obsession and the path to avoid tragedy. They are incredibly doom and gloom and constantly expect the worst to come around every corner. However, Allen's film subverts this with a largely happy and sound landing. Things work out the way they are should with no miscommunication or other romantic comedy cliches. Instead, Allen takes the depressing endings of Greek tragedies and plays it more along the lines of a rom-com where everybody ends up satisfied. This feels like subversion, if only because of the chorus and Allen's repeated references to Greek plays."", ""One of the most prominent plays referenced in the film is Oedipus. With Jocasta (Olympia Dukakis) and Laius (David Ogden Stiers) in the film, Allen makes overt references, but also adds in Kevin (Michael Rapaport). On a date with with porn star and prostitute Linda Ash (Mira Sorvino), Kevin makes repeated references to how he wants a girl like his mother who takes care of the home and makes dinner, etc. Clearly Oedipal, this date is a precursor to the poor guy finding out Linda made porn films. Needless to say, he did not take kindly. The references continue with a fortune teller named Cassandra (Danielle Ferland) who nobody takes seriously as she warns Lenny about tracking down Linda, the mother of his adopted son, and - along with the chorus - warns him about the trap of obsession. Lenny ignores these warnings and goes behind his wife Amanda's (Helena Bonham Carter) back to find Linda to satisfy his own curiosity (the real killer of people, not that **** about the ozone layer\"", as the chorus warns) regarding his brilliant son's roots. The film also introduces Tiresias (Jack Warden), the blind prophet. Warning Lenny as to his wife's potential unfaithfulness, Tiresias sees all and remarks that one would \""have to be blind\"" to not see Amanda's positive response to her potential lover. Oh the dramatic irony."", ""Allen treks on with an ending fit for a Greek tragedy, even if it is not tragic and more in line with a romantic comedy. With Lenny having Linda's son and Linda giving birth to a daughter fathered by Lenny, the two meet again once more a few years after the events of the film. However, they both keep the lineage of their children a secret. They are pleased to see one another with both of them happily married to other people. A classic case of dramatic irony with the audience knowing the truth, but both characters ignorant of the truth, the film's ending is honestly perfect."", ""That said, the film does have some faults. After a hot start with a fast and light opening 20 minutes that leaves you in stitches, the next 40-50 minutes are a bit slower. The humor is more subtle as Allen dives into the plot with Linda. Jokes come, but not like the first 20 minutes, which was constant. Instead, some jokes fall a bit flatter or result in simple chuckles. This section is what separates it from Allen's best works, as the final half hour or so is terrific yet again. However, the second act just slacks a bit and fails to live up to great first and third acts of this film."", ""However, Mighty Aphrodite is still an incredibly funny film that is easy entertainment. With a neurotic and nervy turn from Woody Allen and a great bombastic performance from Mira Sorvino, the film is fun and light entertainment. Allen's films manages to always be a breeze to watch, but always truly mentally engaging at the same time with some philosophical thoughts. But, he instead dumps the philosophy here and goes to the source: Greek tragedies. Allen has a thing for the mind of the Greeks and that becomes all the more clear in this film."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0
the-adventures-of-baron-munchausen;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;Mar  8, 2017;"[ ""The final entry into director Terry Gilliam's \""Trilogy Imagination\"", The Adventures of Baron Munchausen pick up where the final two entries left. An imaginative tale that blurs the line between dreams and reality, the film is incredibly engaging and entertaining throughout with phenomenal performances from the entire cast. As with the previous two films, the film is more of an ode to storytelling as an escape from reality, more than a straight film that can be defined between dreams and the real world. A film about the mysterious Baron Munchausen (John Neville) and his band of odd helpers (Eric Idle, Charles McKeown, Winston Dennis, and Jack Purvis), the Baron crashes a performance of his life story and informs the audience and actors that they are true stories. Though extraordinary, his adventures are not mere legend and, even more, he is the reason why the Turkish sultan is bombing their beloved city because he stole the sultan's treasure. What ensues is a film that is magical and fantastical that reaches comedic and adventure heights like only Gilliam can reach."", ""In the first entry in this trilogy, Time Bandits, Gilliam focused on a child. Living in unhappy home with parents who are more concerned with their material goods than their own son, the boy goes to sleep one night and a small band of thieves pop up in his room. What ensues is an imaginative experience that, though it sets it up as occurring in a dream world, drops a few hints that maybe everything was real. In Brazil, the second installment, Gilliam created a 1984-esque dystopian world that is incredibly real, except for the middle aged protagonist's frequent dreams about a different world, culminating in a dream world breakout from prison that is shown to be anything but real. This film, picking up from there, has the Baron tell his story to the crowd as he simultaneously saves the city from the sultan in a dream world. Only it appears to be a dream world, as by the end, the sultan is gone and the city has been saved. Yet, while all of these films show the stories escaping the dream world and jumping into reality, the line between the two hardly matters."", ""Rather, Gilliam's tales are about the necessity of storytelling and imagination. Objectively, regardless of what the endings show, we all know that dreams are not real. They may reflect reality - as shown in the films by characters in the dreams sharing resemblances with real people, such as Uma Thurman's dual role as city girl Rose and, in the dream, the goddess Venus - but they are simply not real. Gilliam's films, however, suspend this disbelief via storytelling and/or imagination. He fashions his films as an escape from a horrific reality - neglectful parents, dystopian world, a city under siege - with the stories and collective imaginations of the characters being a blissful departure from their traumatic real lives. Thus, the film's finales do not hint at them being real or having actually occurred. Instead, it depicts that it hardly matters. The dream world is objectively better, even if it is not real, than the lives these people lead. Collectively, everybody in these films opt for these falsehoods to enter a state of bliss. In Brazil, the protagonist is declared insane for this, but regardless of his sanity, he has escaped his prison. The boy in Time Bandits escapes in the end via his dreams and the town is saved in this film because they opted to ignore reality and instead enter the world of their imaginations, in which the city is still standing and safe from the sultan."", ""In crafting this world of imagination, Gilliam continuously finds new antics and ideas to introduce. For instance, the moon brings some of the film's comedic heights with a terrific supporting appearance from Robin Williams as The King of the Moon. A floating head trying to escape the carnal tyranny of his body, the King is a higher being who can create Spring by whistling. His wife Queen Ariadne (Valentina Cortese) is similarly able to separate her head from her body and reach a higher state of being. The two not only exist as a statement on the possibilities of the mind without physical limitations, but are also hysterical entries into the film. No matter where the Baron and his child helper Sally Salt (Sarah Polley) wind up, Gilliam's film is imbued with a sense of adventure that capitalizes on the film's naturally whimsical state of being."", ""An uproariously funny and thoroughly engaging film, The Adventures of Baron Munchausen is a film with a lot of moving parts and demonstrates Gilliam's tremendous ability to create fun and smart films for audiences of all ages. Not limited by the PG-rating, the film explores important themes such as honesty, while creating a tale about embracing the oddities of life. No matter where you wind up, there is a way out of it (even death) if you are willing to take chances and embrace possibilities that were previously inconceivable. A fun romp through Gilliam's mind"" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

No longer would sexuality be left to flirtatious hints in the dialogue and no longer would the violence be safe. Instead, Bonnie and Clyde ushered in New Hollywood, an auteur driven era that found American directors reveling in the lifting of the Hays code and lifting all censors from their work. However, American audiences still had to shed their own conceptions as to what can and cannot be allowed in a work of art and it was Bonnie and Clyde that started to make critics and audiences alike realize the potential of this new era. Opening up with Faye Dunaway nude with her back to the camera, it was clear that cinema was about to become far friskier. Rushing to the window without clothes on after hearing the mysterious Clyde Barrow (Warren Beatty) poking around with her mother's car, Dunaway's Bonnie Parker soon takes up with Clyde with Dunaway turning the iconic crime spree girl into a real sexpot. From trying to help Clyde with his impotence to stroking his gun and looking seductively into his eyes, Bonnie Parker practically single-handedly lifts America into this new era with her sultry disposition and raw sexuality."", ""Criticized for celebrating these two murderers, the film actually does anything but when you really look at it all. Bonnie and Clyde are the protagonists, yes, but the film shows their insanity, their hubris, their stupidity, and their greed. Always confident they will never be caught, they take chances and mock those that chase them. They take photos with the police and meet up with random people from whom they had stolen a car. These are two dumb kids who, while maybe not wholly evil, are malevolently moronic. Any average criminal would get caught, but the duo were the benefits of their free wheeling attitude and willingness to drive across the whole of America in committing their crimes. Turning them into myths, the two would show up randomly into a town and rob a bank while the newspaper would attribute them with three times as many robberies in places they had never been. They were ghosts and the go-to for any news story. Had they not driven all over and the media not started printing falsehoods, it is entirely possible they would have been able to be tracked by the police. Instead, it was a wild goose chase until they were able to turn CW Moss (Michael J. Pollard) against the couple."", ""Unafraid to show the graphic results of the couple's violence, we see them kill innocents and kill cops right up close. We see them take on the cops and, yet, we root for them. Through all of their stupidity and murderous intent, the couple are classic cinematic antiheroes who make you root for them out of respect for their pure brazenness and utter lack of inhibition. The film's portrayal of violence, however, breaks through this a bit. From when they kill innocents to when they are finally executed in a hail of bullets, we see what this life of crime brings: violence and a lot of it. Director Arthur Penn uses this violence, alongside the sexuality, to usher in that new era of Hollywood, but to also jar the audience. The violence is unexpected from a film released in 1967. For it to be so bloody and so graphic, audiences at the time had to be running for the hills. I mean, we see a guy get shot five inches from the camera. We see a woman lose her eye. This is a brutal, brutal film. Penn does this shocking level of violence to underscore that Bonnie and Clyde are not to be revered. Their hands are covered in blood and their hubris has caused many good people to die and leave their families behind. While the papers and their legacy has romanticized their status to an insane degree, the gritty details are simple: they are murderers. Bonnie and Clyde is a film that is unafraid to confront this reality, no matter how much it may shock."", ""A boundary smashing film, Arthur Penn's rendition of the classic crime couple Bonnie and Clyde finds Penn introducing overt sexuality, sensuality, and violence to American films in telling this classic story. Not romanticizing it in the least, Penn offers up gruesome recountings of the couple's crime spree across America and shows their immaturity and pride, which ultimately led to their demise in a hail of bullets. Finding Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway doing some of their best work as the classic couple alongside a charismatic and scenery chewing Gene Hackman, Bonnie and Clyde ushered in a new era in film while decisively closing the book on the more romantic beliefs some had regarding Bonnie and Clyde. There is no romance in violence, underscored by Clyde's impotence and the film's refusal to show them as anything but remorseless idiots that stole from others simply because they could, while being unafraid to shoot their way out of a tight spot."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0
true-lies;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;Aug  5, 2017;"[ ""Cheesy, stupid, and bombastic, in all of the right ways, James Cameron's True Lies is a quintessential American action from the 1980s/1990s. Loaded to the point of bursting with one-liners, cleavage, and explosions, True Lies is the type of macho insanity that keeps men lining up to watch action films to this very day. Yet, action films of today lack the same whimsical sense of stupid brilliance that films such as True Lies captured so effortlessly. Somewhere in the one-line dropping courtesy of Arnold Schwarzenegger, Cameron turns True Lies into a ballet of testosterone, sexism, and penis envy, that only he can make come off so effortlessly excellent. Without the cruel restraints of telling a serious story found in Cameron's prior action work, he is allowed to fully indulge in explosions and carnage in a way that Michael Bay only wishes he could. Honestly, if Bay did not watch this film and walk home crying, I would be stunned."", ""As an action comedy film, True Lies never takes itself too seriously. Indulging in over-the-top explosions, rescue missions, and absurd plot turns, Cameron lets the audience know from the jump that this is really just male fantasy in film form. Dropping in Arnold Schwarzenegger as the audience surrogate, allowing men in the crowd to feel one with his overtly masculine appearance, we experience his world vicariously through him. Cool, calm, married to Jamie Lee Curtis, and spitting game with Tia Carrere, Arnold's secret agent Harry Tasker is what every man would openly admit to wanting to be. Toss in a few \""cool guys don't look at explosions\"" moments to open this film and this becomes a proverbial wet dream for macho men everywhere or wimpy men who wish to be macho. Just watch his cool under the pressure demeanor, casual one-liners as he beats the pulp out of a man just as buff as himself (\""here cool off\""), and rushes to save his wife and daughter from the grasp of international terrorists, and try to deny that every man does not want to be Harry. He saves the day. Looks good doing it and gets every girl around. There is an obvious appeal and Cameron plays it to cartoony perfection, ditching reality in the name of just embracing the cheese. It is a stupid film to be sure, but scenarios where we all dream of being a hero under pressure are undoubtedly just as stupid so it is only natural the film would be the same way."", ""Yet, equally as obvious is how the film would line up with the theories of Yvonne Tasker regarding masculinity in these macho, testosterone-filled films. Torturing the male form from beginning to end, True Lies is loaded with explosions and pain for Arnold. With Harry Tasker getting beat up brutally at every turn, having his clothes ripped, and having to lift himself up off of the brink of certain death, he is a man who seems to have a very low life expectancy. While he may not bleed as much as some of his opponents, this is not an easy mission for him and is one that leads to him having to change his ripped shirts for a different one quite often. With the rips and the action, however, the male physique is constantly turned into spectacle here and the reason why any tickets were sold. In the most intimate action set piece - the bathroom scene - there are no explosions but lots of gunfire and fighting. Pitting Harry Tasker with a man just as big as himself, this spectacle of two men in peak physical condition is undeniable and brought to the forefront."", ""However, the film certainly tortures the men a bit in a different way. Men define themselves by the women they get and their ability to please them, hence male insecurity regarding their privates and jealousy. With Helen Tasker (Curtis) beginning to stray due to the lack of intimacy with Harry, he diverts resources to find out who her mystery man Simon (Bill Paxton) is and makes concerted efforts to track him down. Highlighting male insecurity regarding their spouses and inability to satisfy their urges as they expect they should be able to do, True Lies is a film that both tortures men over this area of weakness and gives great release. Upon finding Simon, beating him up, making him admit to have a \""little dick\"", and pee on himself, Harry is able to feel like a bigger man and more secure in his position as the only man in Helen's life. Even if she had strayed with Simon, Harry's presumably better endowment and full masculine confidence in every situation ensures that he could take Simon quite easily if it came down to it. It, like the rest of the film, is a fantasy-driven representation of men's desire to possess their significant others, outperform other men, and fulfill their significant other's every need. It is a competition to the very end in both life and the film."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0
brazil;9;Spangle;/user/Spangle;Feb  2, 2017;"[ ""Simultaneously the second entry into Terry Gilliam's \""Trilogy of Imagination\"" and the first entry in his \""Dystopian Trilogy\"", Brazil is a masterwork of pure satirical genius. More aligned with modern day America than I am comfortable to admit, Brazil is a cautionary tale of government control where freedom is assumed, but is merely an illusion. Working in the Ministry of Information, Sam Lowry (Jonathan Pryce) is a lowly worker who just does as he is told and keeps plugging along with no aspirations for anything better. Except, he keeps having dreams where he is a winged angel and trying to save a mystery girl. Learning that this girl is Jill Layton (Kim Greist), Sam tries to find her, only to discover that the government believes her to be a violent terrorist. Now, he must subvert the government to find the girl that he loves. A visually rich and thematically dense film, Brazil is a hard nut to crack and though this review will make it sound like I know what I am talking about, allow me to assure you that the opposite is in fact true."", ""In my review of Time Bandits, the first entry in the \""Trilogy of Imagination\"", I highlighted one of the major themes in that work as being materialism. With a psychotic obsession towards material items over their own child, Kevin's parents in that film ignore him at all costs. Gilliam continues this thematic discussion in Brazil, except it takes on a particularly politically charged tone. During the Cold War, the American government equated the communists with being godless heathens. Therefore, to be truly godly, one must be a capitalist. As such, spending and material goods are good and a glory to God. Throughout the film, Gilliam critiques this idea with a visual motif of a glowing blue cross in various shots, but also takes shots at the biggest glorification to capitalism in existence: Christmas. Setting Brazil during Christmas time allowed Gilliam to adorn each scene with a reference to the gift giving holiday. Everybody in the film has some asinine gift they are carrying or give to another person. Sam receives presents from nearly everybody he sees in the film and it is never something he truly wants. Interesting to note as well that nobody says \""Merry Christmas\"" in the film, rather they always say \""Happy Christmas\"". However, Gilliam ensures that this is a religious critique during a sequence in a shopping mall. One boy is carrying what appears to be a folder that reads, \""Consumers for Christ\"" on the cover. Similar to the glowing blue cross, this folder is also blue. Highlighting the capitalist indoctrination disguised as Christianity, Gilliam decries the linking together of religion and mindless consumption above all else. This is further emphasized through Sam's mother (Katherine Helmond) and her friend Mrs. Terrain (Barbara Hicks). The two are constantly getting face lifts to look younger and while Mrs. Lowry's goes fine, Mrs. Terrain is constantly shown with bandages due to her complications having complications. For Gilliam, this is a way of punishing the vanity and mindless materialism and consumption that has gone on in our present society."", ""This is further underscored in a callback to Sergei Eisenstein's Battleship Potemkin and the famous Odessa steps sequence. In that famous sequence, people are gunned down on the Odessa steps by guards and, as she runs down, a mother's baby carriage gets stuck and begins to tumble down the steps. Gilliam takes this scene as inspiration towards the end as Sam has a dream about escaping from the prison he is held in. During his breakout - with the help of Archibald \""Harry\"" Tuttle (Robert De Niro) - the guards in the Ministry of Information are shooting at the escapees from the stairs and begin walking down them. As they do, a vacuum tumbles down the steps akin to the baby carriage in Battleship Potemkin. Here, Gilliam creates a parallel between the baby and the vacuum, in essence saying that we now serve machines and the system, instead of our children and one another. Our purpose and focus in life has shifted from each other to the soulless machines in the name of innovation. This is further confirmed, in hindsight, by a sequence earlier in the film. The chief torturer of the Ministry of Information is a friend of Sam's named Jack (Michael Palin). While visiting with Jack, Sam sees Jack speak to one of his three children. During this conversation, Jack calls the girl \""Amy\"" and later \""Chloe\"", despite the girl's protests that she is actually \""Holly\"". He seems disinterested and makes a crack about never really knowing anymore. For Jack and for everybody else living in this dystopian society, the only things that matter are work, consumption, and maintaining the status quo determined by those in power. All else fall by the waste side, especially family. Viewed in conjunction with the vacuum/baby carriage parallel, it is clear that Gilliam wishes to highlight this as a major fault in our present society."" ]";0;0;0;0;1;0

At times, Stillman's packed dialogue filled with wordy attempts at brilliance can come off as awkward or pretentious, but in reality, they are astute critique of the type of individuals who say these types of things.

However, it is the rare comedy that does not rely upon absurd plot happenings or even a plot at all. Though a heist comedy, it is a film about its characters due to Cleese's strong character writing with practically all of the humor being derived from their encounters with one another or what they will do to finally get their hands on the money at the end of the rainbow. A smart and witty film, A Fish Called Wanda is comedy with a brain, a great script, and absolutely phenomenal performances across the board. Thus, it becomes a truly well-rounded piece of entertainment that never misses a beat for the entirety of its runtime."", ""Starting off with a heist pulled off by craft George Thomason (Tom Georgeson), Wanda (Jamie Lee Curtis), sharpshooter Otto (Kevin Kline), and stutterer Ken (Michael Palin), A Fish Called Wanda takes a pretty typical turn when everybody quickly turns against one another after the heist, causing the score to get lost in the shuffle. Yet, like a Coen brothers film, the heist is just an excuse to begin to explore these characters so this narrative cliche is rather excusable. As the diamonds are hidden in some sort of safety deposit box that is in some hotel, near an iconic location, has a key, and is number something, it is required that the group of four work together to be able to get to those diamonds. However, with George in jail and Ken left for dead by Otto and Wanda, it seems as though that bit may be a tall task. Enter barrister Archie Leach (John Cleese). In a loveless marriage and the barrister for George, Archie is a prime target for the large breasted Wanda to use her tricks to get the necessary information from George to be able to find where the diamonds are locked up. While the diamonds are eventually found, it is truly a battle of attrition and one that often takes a backseat to the characters on display."", ""With this room to explore the characters, Cleese's incredibly smart script takes full advantage by developing the whole cast nicely, of which Otto and Archie really shine as the best figures in the film. A jealous and neurotic moron, Otto is an incredibly talented marksman, but a moron in every other walk of life. Introducing the running visual gag of having him pop up whenever girlfriend Wanda is set to sleep with Archie, Otto's presence in the film is always a welcome one. Showing him to be deeply unhinged and stupid, Cleese's script constantly establishes him as a figure who lacks any sense of sympathy. Criticizing Ken for his stutter, encouraging him to kill an old woman, calling any other driver whose car he hits an **** or insulting Ken again at the end of the film, Otto's stupidity does not just come from what he knows but in how he treats others. He is funny to watch thanks to Kevin Kline's incredible and well-deserved Oscar winning performance, but is certainly quite a villainous figure with just how sinister and cold he is towards everybody around him. If he cannot gain something out of a situation, he does not care. Lacking empathy and bordering on being a sociopath, Otto is an unhinged and loose cannon just waiting to implode."", ""Alongside Otto, Archie is a tremendous character. Trapped in this loveless marriage, poor Archie walks right into the bear trap that is Wanda with very little prodding whatsoever. She is sex personified and Archie is absolutely desperate, so it is a natural fit. A smart and capable barrister, Archie is a tad bit dead inside and the opportunity to run off with somebody like Wanda is a welcome one. While his descent into becoming a criminal may seem a bit much on the surface, for a man so cooped up and dependent on his wife, he is liable to do anything once given the leeway and freedom to actually make up his own mind and not deal with somebody's **** constantly. Portraying the character himself, John Cleese is outstanding. Infusing the film with great comedy in the writing of the character, Cleese's relatively straight performance that slowly becomes more-and-more comedic in nature as he ascends into freedom, Cleese plays this repressed and locked up husband figure terrifically and with great spirit. While Kline steals the show, Cleese's comedic performance consistently delivers laughs, while his dramatic performance early on convinces the audience that he is in fact an incredibly successful barrister."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

This connection made the events here all the more tragic and hard to watch. The acting here is great, especially from R. Lee Ermey, who really steals the show. Stanley Kubrick's direction is fabolous as expected as well. The first half here is also far superior to the second half, in large part thanks to Ermey, but really, all of the events in the first half are much better presented than the second half, which at times, can be a little odd in the way things occur. But, the second half is still quite good, even if a little bit of a drop off from the perfect first half.

However, my favorite part was certainly the little touches throughout. I don't really have a specific example, but images in the background or a small reference here and there that were absolutely fantastic.

Terrifically thrilling, Snake Eyes features Nicolas Cage as Richard Santoro, a charismatic and corrupt Atlantic City police detective who witnesses an assassination during a boxing match. Supported by a strong supporting performance from Gary Sinise as Commander Kevin Dunne, Snake Eyes is a spellbinding conspiracy thriller that is terrific to the very last drop."", """", ""Featuring all of De Palma's major trademarks, Snake Eyes is a showcase for his lovely camera work. The tracking shot at the very beginning of Richard Santoro walking through the arena is terrific, but what makes it all the much better is De Palma's repeated use of split-screen later on in the film that showcases how perception changes everything. For Santoro, he believed he knew what had occurred during the shooting. He thought he knew the players. It was only through speaking to Julia Costello (Carla Gugino) and Lincoln Tyler (Stan Shaw) that his eyes were opened. De Palma does a terrific job of using the split-screen to showcase the different perspectives a situation can have and how that can lead to false conclusions if you do not have both takes on a situation."", """", ""The camera work also comes into play when Julia is going up to a man's room and the camera pans through an aerial shot of the rooms on the floor. While it may not add much to the overall film, it was incredibly stylish and highlighted a very important element to the story: it was not about the assassination. In every room, people were either celebrating something completely unrelated or changing the channel from the news. For De Palma, this essentially serves to refocus the audience on what actually matters: the characters. Having read the critical reception, I was particularly struck by a quote from De Palma himself in which he stated, \""There's a lot of discussion in Snake Eyes about why do we reveal who did it so soon. Well the problem is that it isn't about who did it. It's a mystery about a relationship, two people, and how finding that out affects their relationship... Those kind of procedural movies are extremely boring...\"" In essence, for me, many critics wind up missing the point of the film. While I loved it a conspiracy thriller and thought it was thoroughly captivating in this regard, De Palma's aim was to showcase the fracturing of the friendship between Santoro and Dunne when Santoro finds out the truth about his long time friend. Thus, the sequence in which he shows everyone ignoring the news of the assassination, it becomes clear that De Palma is trying to nudge the audience away from the murder mystery aspect and onto the character study."", """", ""As a character study, the film is equally riveting. Richard Santoro's reaction to the news, as relayed to him by Julia Costello who was revealing the conspiracy to the assassinated Secretary of Defense when the killing happened, is perfection. Cage brings the emotions to life and wears them on his sleeve in this sequence as you can see Santoro's heartbreak and, at first, deny that this is what occurred. His dedication to his friend is being tested, but he knows that it is true. When he finds video evidence confirming what she had told him was true, his heartbreak over losing his childhood friend is shattering and tremendous cinema. This is truly where the writing from David Koepp excels, as he manages to develop his characters so well, while also subtly keeping them within their characters even if its seems out-of-character, if that makes sense. For Santoro, he is established as being an adulterer and a corrupt cop. Yet, he wants to be mayor, which is why he wants to solve this case. For him, he may put on a facade of being charismatic and magnanimous, but deep down, he wants more than his current lot in life. For Kevin Dunne, he may seem like the \""goody two shoes\"", but instead he is ruthless and manipulative, willing to do anything to get ahead. These characters truly come to life thanks to the writing from Koepp."", """", ""Another element captured incredibly well by De Palma is the chaos. This element is really put on display during the assassination, which is a chaotic, thrilling, and hectic sequence that is equally hectically shot. You can hardly tell what is going on and can feel your own heart beating as this sequence unfolds. This feeling is sustained throughout the film, in large part due to the free flowing camera of De Palma. It truly captures the significant amount of moving parts within the film and the chaos, as the long tracking shots emphasize. In particular, the opening tracking shot involves numerous different moments that could be a scene all on their own. Santoro runs into many different people and the camera struggles to keep up with him."" ]";0;0;0;0;1;0
the-last-emperor;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;Mar  9, 2014;"[ ""Now this is an epic. The film has a regal air about it as it tells the story of Puyi, the last Emperor or China. At the end of the day, it is clear as day why this one won the Oscars it won and just how deserving it truly was. The film sympathetically portrays the final Emperor as we cannot help but look at him as a man who was revered as a small child, but as time went on, his power becomes less-and-less, before he completely loses all of it. What really makes this film work is the acting. The performance by John Lone as the adult Puyi, as well as the child actors who portray Puyi in his younger years is marvelous, as is the supporting work turned in by Peter O'Toole. On top of this, the sets throughout were top-notch and really oozed of that time period and really captured the essence of the era depicted."", """", ""On the negative side of things, the film can be hard to follow at times, what with flash forward storytelling that is utilized. You kind of have to re-adjust to the storyline, as well as who the characters are, since there are quite a bit of them. The other complaint I have is certainly the length. While I watched the two hour and 40 minute version, it still felt a little on the long side, especially considering that there was no real...action or drama that gripped you enough for it to warrant being as long as it is."" ]";1;1;1;0;0;0
out-of-sight;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;Jul 27, 2014;"[ ""At the end of the day, Out of Sight is a common heist film, but its nonlinear storytelling, great performances, and good direction, elevate it above the genre it is a part of. From the very beginning, it has you hooked and does not let go until the end. George Clooney is great in the lead role as expected. Jennifer Lopez, who I had never seen act before, also does a good job at doing what she does best; being sexy. Her acting is also good. Ving Rhames and Don Cheadle also have very good supporting turns here. I am not a huge fan of Steven Soderbergh usually, but he does very well here in the director's chair and manages to craft a very entertaining romantic crime film and make the romance feel authentic and the crime element thrilling and exciting. In addition, the comedy element was good. It was not gut busting laugh after gut busting laugh, but it was used sparingly and effectively to lighten up the mood. Overall, Out of Sight is a good, entertaining film that feels like more than your regular old heist film."" ]";0;1;0;1;0;0

With strong lead performances from Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon, as well as the rest of the cast. Really the true star here is the people who handled the color, which is just unreal. The blending of color and black and white....just wow. When it transitions in a scene so seamlessly, it is truly something to behold. Director Gary Ross does a good job blending the social commentary with sheer family values demonstrated by this stereotypical 50's television show that blends with the real world in this film. The pacing is good and the storytelling keeps everything clear even as things steadily get me complex.

Though it is a typical romantic comedy in many respects, Aaron Sorkin is such a talented writer, he manages to reinvent the wheel. Charming, cute, and sweet romantically, while tough, smart, and poignant politically, The American President is a really top-notch film that is a masterclass in writing. Every word of dialogue oozes with power and weight, while demonstrating Sorkin's talent at creating incredibly well developed characters. Even better, the perfect writing allows this tremendous cast led by Michael Douglas, Annette Bening, Martin Sheen, and Michael J. Fox to really take off and soar. Not only is the character development top-notch here, but it is a truly compelling and poignant look at politics and the presidency, especially the interesting idea as to what would transpire if the President dated during this age of the media. Comedically, the film is incredibly smart, quick, and witty, showing that Sorkin is just as adept at writing a hilarious film as he is a smart one. Overall, The American President is a showcase for all the Sorkinisms that make his writing so damn perfect. Though typical, the film is so well-written, those cliches are ignorable because this is those cliches at their very best. Hard to imagine these cliches being better executed."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

The plot is very complex, but once you wrap your head around it and begin to understand everything, it becomes very enjoyable and easy watching. In fact, it shocked me how straight forward it wound up being, as I expected it to be far more confounding. I am typically not a huge science fiction fan, but this one really wound up working for me and though the shoved in romantic elements bother me as always. On top of that, how it pretty much turns into an action film (especially towards the end) is another sour note here.

The mise en scene, as a whole, is great as well as the scenery was top-notch. In addition, the soundtrack made me absolutely swoon. If I had not already been swept off of my feet, the soundtrack would have swept me off my feet, but in the end, it just serves as further evidence of the sheer beauty of this film. Just wow. In terms of the story, I thought it, as well, was beautifully presented. From the early encounters to the very end, there is a certain beauty to the interaction between the characters as Dunbar adjusts to his new situation. In terms of the acting, Kevin Costner and a cast of relative unknowns did a great job. Initially, I was unsure about Costner and did not like his performance that much in the beginning, but as the film progressed, he won me over completely. The final note I want to make is on the length. It is three hours, so it is up there in terms of time, but it never really shows its length. Instead, it almost tricks you into thinking it is much shorter in the way it utilizes every second to tell its story."" ]";0;0;0;0;1;0

armageddon;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;Sep  8, 2016;"[ ""For a long time, I put off watching Armageddon because I always anticipated it being an overlong, dumb, explosion fest courtesy of Michael Bay. However, the fact that it is a part of the Criterion Collection gave me significant cognitive dissonance. After watching it, Armageddon is unabashedly stupid and if films such as Top Gun, Days of Thunder, and Independence Day, did not exist, I would call it the stupidest film of all-time. Yet, just as with those films, I am unashamed supporter of Armageddon. It may be dumb, but it is a film about human perseverance in times of turmoil and has a heart that is proudly wears on its sleeve."", """", ""Though I would be hard pressed to call the acting good, it is never anything worse than average, which is just fine for the perfect example of when the Hollywood machine can churn out a film with a strong directorial vision courtesy of Michael Bay that showcases all that he does right. While it is dumb and loud, Bay's ability to create emotion, thrills, and tension never shines through better than in this film and he, unlike in other endeavors, gets overly side tracked by bad jokes or dumb plots. Instead, he stays honed in on what matters and, even better, the jokes delivered by Steve Buscemi from beginning to end all hit. In fact, they may be one of the best parts of the film."", """", ""As with Independence Day, it is hard not be in awe of this film at times. A glorious piece of 1990s cheesy action, Armageddon is filled with impactful one liners that give you chills, action set pieces that thrill, and an uncanny ability to make me fight back tears while watching a film about exploding an asteroid by drilling a hole into it. The tender scenes between Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler, the interactions between Tyler and Bruce Willis, as well as those between Willis and Affleck are all heart breaking put together. Beautifully shot, orchestrated, and written, these particular character interactions stand out in a film that knows how to write camaraderie between its character, especially the drillers."", """", ""While its action is obvious, the writing is really what elevates this. The plot may be dumb, but what is not dumb about Armageddon is its ability to create human characters with heart, passion, fears, and shortcomings. The development of their relationships and backgrounds is very impressive for a film of this type. This writing is what got it included in the Criterion Collection and it is not undeserved. The plot may be silly, but those behind the script knew what they were doing and knew how to write an action film. Plot be damned, Armageddon packs an emotional punch while Bay manages to expertly give weight and balance the romance, passion, and action in one deliciously put together spectacle."", """", ""Armageddon may be one of the dumbest movies ever in terms of plot, but its writing and willingness to explore the bonds between father-daughter and grown men is an impressive feat for a blockbuster of this type. Color me surprised that this Michael Bay-led disaster was anything but a misguided attempt to entertain teenage boys.

dead-ringers;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;Feb 23, 2017;"[ ""Directors of horror films or just weird movies in general tend to gravitate towards tales of identical or siamese twins. David Cronenberg is no different as he demonstrates in Dead Ringers. Based on a true story to a certain degree, the film tells the story of Beverly and Elliott Mantle (Jeremy Irons), twin gynecologists who often pretend to be one another, even with women such as actress Claire Niveau (Genevieve Bujold). Unfortunately for them, this \""pretending\"" is really a manifestation of their affliction: they are siamese twins that are not connected. Their bodies and souls are one, even if their brains go elsewhere. As a result, one becoming addicted to drugs has a detrimental effect on the duo. Featuring class Cronenberg psychology and body horror, Dead Ringers is a creepy and unsettling film from beginning to end."", ""Featuring Jeremy Irons in a tremendous dual role, Dead Ringers explores the inner working of the mind of a twin who is unmistakably connected to their twin. Messing with their mind and interfering with their daily lives, this connection is one neither is truly aware of or able to cope with. Irons plays these two tormented souls drifting between the calm, cool, and collected nature of them initially during undergrad and when they begin their careers to when their twisted insides and mutant nature interferes on their daily lives and turns both into dying drug addicts who have lost their minds. Deeply psychological, Irons convincingly brings to life the fractured nature of these men's psyches and deftly shows the impact it has on their daily lives with Claire or any of their patients."", ""Cronenberg, for his part, never truly exploits the situation or the afflictions of his character. Rather, as he is prone to do, he explores the difference. The mutant nature and convoluted interiors of a siamese/identical twin is on full display here, as well as the mental torment it can cause for a person. In exploring this dark side of the human mind, Cronenberg naturally finds a lot of horror and effectively delivers scares to the audience via the torment the characters go through. Above all, his trademark body horror comes into play throughout and at the very end. Surgery and gynecology are a natural fit for Cronenberg, especially when the men believe they are looking at mutant women with weird insides. This paranoia and weird bit of body horror is vintage Cronenberg in how he has fun with messing up the human body and finding horror by making the audience's skin crawl as weird surgical tools are used in operation or people are cut open. The film is very visceral in this front as can be expected. It is also where much of the horror can be found, particularly with the violent psychological body horror finale when Beverly tries to separate them as conjoined twins, even though they are not actually conjoined."", ""Messed up, twisted, and classic Cronenberg, Dead Ringers may not be nearly as effective in creating scares or messing with one's mind as some of his best work, but it does succeed in creating a creepy atmosphere for Jeremy Irons to have terrific fun with. Irons is creepy, weird, and oddly charismatic in the role as the two twins, playing two distinctly different people who just happen to share a deep, deep connection. This atmosphere lends itself to the excellent character study, writing, and embracing of the more psychological and twisted elements brought forth by the film. Though perhaps not as great of a study of the mind as his later film Spider, the film still explores this unique mental illness to chilling effect, making up for its \""lesser\"" character study with more effective scares and chills. Though hardly one of Croneberg's weirder films, Dead Ringers is oddly reserved for this period in his career and, aside from a few gross out scenes, is largely far more mental and less focused on absurd elements such as the underground. Instead, Dead Ringers is about the connection between twins seen through the eyes of a master of body horror. The end result is just as good as one could expect."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

Had it been released in the 1940s or 1950s, with some small tweaks, it would have been right at home. In 1992, it served as a last beacon of a bygone era in film. Directed by Carl Franklin, One False Move is a Southern-set film about three people - Ray Malcolm (Billy Bob Thornton), Fantasia (Cynda Williams), and Pluto (Michael Beach) - that kill six people and rip off a drug dealer. Headed to Star City, Arkansas after hoping to have sold the drugs in Houston, LAPD detectives Dud Cole (Jim Metzler) and John McFeely (Earl Billings) head to Arkansas to wait for them. In Arkansas, they are greeted by Dale \""Hurricane\"" Dixon (Bill Paxton), the Chief of Police in the small city. A rough and tumble neo-noir, One False Move has flaws, but is also a tightly wound yarn that keeps you guessing till very last drop."", ""One False Move is one of those films that is incredibly meticulous. The staging is detailed, every word and action is precise and carries great meaning and purpose. There are no throwaway lines or scenes that could be cut to trim any fat. The film is tightly plotted and written. Billy Bob Thornton's script is streamlined and explores a few subplots, but they all contribute to the main plot. For this to be his first produced script, it is incredibly impressive and shows the talent he has as a writer. Yet, the film is quintessential noir in the sense that it is entirely character-driven. Though the plot is important and one that entertains, the characters are really what makes the film sing. This does lead to some problems in the script, but the characters never cease to be entertaining and the actors all bring solid performances to the table that justify the character focus of the film."", ""However, the film's greatest fault in its characters is how it rests on cultural stereotypes as a shorthand. Dale Dixon, the Arkansas cop, is an over-eager and bubbly fellow who is like a kid at Spring Training yelling for his favorite ballplayer to come sign a baseball for him. He wants to go to Los Angeles and become a cop after this experience and cannot get enough of the LA detectives and the fact that the crime spree is coming to him. The classic smalltown kind of guy from the South, he says the n-word a lot casually. The town of Star City similarly involves cliches with Dale and Fantasia/Lyla Walker having a history that the film seems to believe is a twist, but just typing the words above give it away. It is not a well-hidden secret and one, once hinted at, will become incredibly easy to pick out. Again, it is quite cliche in that element. The LA cops even represent cultural cliches with both feeling above the Arkansas cop, who is not a \""real cop\"". Laughing at his dream to go west and be a cop there, they are self-absorbed jerks who drink their own kool-aid. In other words, they are big city cops that believe they are God's gift to police work. While the script is still terrific, these cultural stereotypes are a bit of a short hand in lieu of unique characterization."", ""However, in the less character-focused moments, One False Move continues to provide excellent entertainment. Thrilling, edge-of-your-seat sequences such as simple ones in a gas station, being followed on the Texas highway, or the final shootout, the film keeps you guessing and in complete suspense. The film takes its time, never rushing through intense moments and instead allowing the audience to feel every drop of suspense possible. In many ways, it is akin to the recent release, Hell or High Water. It is a country-fried thriller dipped in BBQ, highlighted in One False Move's diegetic score towards the end with the harmonica. It really sets the tone perfectly and, if the country roads were not an indicator, it highlights the country."", ""One False Move is a terrific neo-noir. Involving a very detailed and thrilling plot, the film is character-driven with the characters taking centerstage. Though they can be a bit cliched, they never stop entertaining the audience with each beat of the story that happens. One False Move's biggest sin is that is can be a predictable, but it more than make up for it with its incredibly written dialogue, characters, and plot that are not smartly put together, but incredibly detailed and highly engrossing. A small film that was fashioned as a straight-to-DVD release in 1992, One False Move is still greatly overlooked in the world of cinema and that is a shame. Though hardly groundbreaking, the tight direction from Carl Franklin, good cast, and incredibly well-written script make the film one that should not be missed."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0
sex-lies-and-videotape;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;Jan 12, 2017;"[ ""The fact that this is a debut is astounding, as is the fact that I used to not like Steven Soderbergh. Honestly, for sure a talented guy, he is often somebody I forget about, even if I enjoy his films. Years ago, my first introduction was The Informant, which I actually walked out of in theaters. That may have been a mistake, but I still need to rewatch (or fully watch) it to find out for sure. Afterwards, I watched Contagion and hated it, becoming fully convinced that he was a hack. Of course, as my recent rewatch showed, my opinion on Contagion has changed a lot. Since seeing these two long ago, I have seen and loved many of his works including Traffic, Solaris, Side Effects, Out of Sight, and I am even an apologist for his throwback 2006 bomb The Good German. Tobey Maguire may be a miss in the movie, but it is still a great take on 1940s noir, dammit! Now, this introductory paragraph exists largely because this is his first feature. Often times, watching a debut from a director whose work you enjoy proves disappointing. Sex, Lies, and Videotape, however, is not your typical work. An exploration into human sexuality with a raw, unhinged, and delightfully odd script, the film may lack the polish of his later works, but there is terrific wealth in that lack of polish."", ""Sex, Lies, and Videotape is about the arrival of a mysterious man, Graham (James Spader), who used to be friends in college with John (Peter Gallagher). Previously incredibly promiscuous, Graham is now impotent and only able to perform alone. As such, he videotapes women talking about sex and their history of having sex. This sometimes can get a little sensual, but Graham never actually does anything with a subject and is strict with nobody else seeing a tape. One of the women he tapes, Cynthia (Laura San Giacomo) has heard about Graham from her sister Ann (Andie MacDowell). Repulsed by his tapes, Ann tries to stop her sexually liberal sister from seeing him, but Cynthia cannot be stopped. Of course, the awkward part is that Ann is very reserved and is married to Graham's old friend John, who is now a successful lawyer. John, meanwhile, is sleeping with Cynthia who sleeps with him to get back at her older sister."", ""As may be clear, this creates some issues, but it really creates some odd healing. This confrontation of their approach to sex and their pasts allows the characters to really confront why they are the way that they are. For Ann, she is able to find herself and figure out why she does not enjoy sex. For Cynthia, it allows her to confront why she hates Ann and work on a worthwhile way of healing that. In the process, of course, it does show a lot about their characters. The sisters fight because they are inherently different and the other cannot accept that difference. It is also clear that Cynthia does a lot of what she does for attention, hinting at the popularity of Ann in school among the boys and, likely, her parents. Thus, it gives her a rush to know she is sleeping with Ann's husband and is better at sex than her. Via the videotapes, however, the women are able to figure this out and identify these issues. At the end, when we see Ann give Cynthia her work number and a gift, it becomes clear that the olive branch is there. Though they talked and had a relationship, they only spoke of each negatively and had terrible conversations on the phone. It is clear that the relationship is fractured and confronting what has made them who they are and driven them apart (sex), allows them to heal and work on the relationship."", ""This development is incredibly written by Soderbergh who creates a nuanced plot with nuanced characters that really grow throughout the film. For a debut, this is quite the accomplishment, especially with the mature way in which he handles sex. Instead of exploiting it or turning it into simple titillation, he turns it into an act worthy of psycho-therapeutic study. Of course, the strong characters and dialogue are bolstered by good performances in all roles, particularly by James Spader. As the unusual and very open Graham, Spader oozes weird yet comforting. His oddities may be a turn off to those who do not know him, but for that those do, he is an welcome part of their lives."", ""Incredibly written, directed, and acted, this one is a shockingly assured debut. While imperfect, the film is one that leaves you sitting there and contemplating your life in a weird way, just as the characters here are forced to assess who they are and where they are.

Now, it is very, very slow and can be a tad dull for sure, but for the most part, it is wraps you up and refuses to let go. The imagery is immaculate and you can see Kubrick's trademark cinematography here and it is absolutely gorgeous. It was hard to pick my jaw up from the floor at times when seeing the beautiful images he managed to construct. In addition, the special effects are phenomenal. For 2014 they are great, let alone for 1968. Just absolutely stunning to watch. The sets are also brilliantly put together. In terms of sound, the soundtrack is phenomenal and is a great companion to the images. The acting here is solid, but that was all that was required, as there is not that much dialogue where acting is crucial, but they were competent and in the more dialogue carried sequences did well. This film is undoubtedly tough to grasp after watching it, but there is certainly more going on than meets the eye. However, what does meet the eye is the brilliant imagery and amazing \""future\"" (past now) that Stanley Kubrick put on screen. Just truly a brilliant work of art."" ]";1;1;1;0;0;0

Fantastically funny and a great look at high school in the 1970s, Dazed and Confused is a fun and enjoyable ride that may start off a bit odd, but once it hits its stride, it's a true joy. The ensemble cast is fantastic and it is tragic that a lot of them did not get any major roles after this, aside from this obvious few because they are all a delight. Matthew McConaughey does steal the show though of course with his multiple iconic lines that will continue to live on forever. Overall, Dazed and Confused is a truly enjoyable high school stoner comedy that is fantastically written and directed by Linklater."" ]";1;1;1;0;0;0
thief;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;Nov 18, 2016;"[ ""The feature-length debut for Michael Mann, Thief shows off Mann's tidy camerawork, ear for a great score, and his ability to craft smart thrillers. Starring James Caan, Thief is a neo-noir film about a man, essentially, looking to do one last job before settling down, but his ties to the mob makes this impossible. Tense, thrilling, and blessed with great acting, music, and direction, Thief is a powerhouse of a crime film."", ""Firstly, the acting in the film is first-rate. James Caan stars as Frank. His Frank is a very complicated mobster, balancing brilliance with welding tools used to crack locks with a deep desire to have a family. He is, in many ways, an incredibly relatable man in this regard. Caan really brings this element to life and balances the character's brilliance, rage, and compassion. When he and the audience realize there is no way out for him, the film and Caan manage to create a great deal of empathy. All of this empathy is earned through his speech to Jessie (Tuesday Weld) in the bar. One of the iconic scenes of the film, Frank pours his heart out to Jessie and explains why he wants her in his life."", ""Aside from Caan, the other character who really grabs this film by the horns is Leo (Robert Prosky). The aging mob boss, Leo is a ruthless man. He may take care of those who help him, but make no mistake, Leo will do anything to make a profit. This is emphasized in his final speech to Frank when he lays everything out for him as to why he will continue to work for him. From threatening his family, threatening to prostitute his wife, and more, Leo is a menacing figure who instills great fear. Prosky captures this perfectly, yet nimbly transitions between that intensity to the scene following, in which one of his henchmen asks if he wants milk to which Leo replies, \""No I'm fine\"". Seemingly innocuous, this moment really shows the two sides of the character - between ruthless mobster and typical old man - that Prosky really does a stellar job bringing to life."", ""In terms of the camera work, there are some seriously terrific shots here courtesy of Mann. Particularly, the sequence in the home when Frank breaks in and when Frank is breaking into the lock for the \""big score\"". In the former, which happens later, Mann laces the film with a lot of tension through quick sweeping turns with the camera and of Caan himself. His fear is evident and permeates to the audience, leaving us completely on the edge of our seats. In the robbery sequence, a lot of this same tension occurs, but really is just eye candy at times when the orange flame encompasses the entire frame. One of the most notable shots utilized here, however, has to be the repeated upside down shots. There are two major moments I can think of, one because it looks good and the other because of the moment it captures. The former is of Frank driving his black car and we see nothing but the hood and the lights of the city glistening off its sleek black coat. Pure eye candy. The latter is when Leo is threatening Frank. The entire time, Leo is upside down and thinks really creates an effect further discomforting the viewer and Frank. Though the scene is intense on its own due to the language used by Leo, Mann increases the tension further through this shot by making it feel wholly foreign and uncomfortable."", ""Musically, Thief is incredible. Somehow, this score was nominated for a Razzie, but I guess that just shows how smart the people who run that award show are. Often rousing and always instilled with this psychedelic(?) rock-and-roll sound, the score for Thief can often consume a shot and further elevate the intensity of the moment. Really, a lot of this film is intended to create discomfort for the audience. The score really accomplishes this throughout, even if it is pleasing to the ears for the most part. It can be quite jarring and unsettling when it crescendos and truly leaves you trying to escape its grasp."", ""Thief is a thrilling and exciting crime film with some flaws - namely an underdeveloped element with Okla (Willie Nelson) - and some poor character development for people not named Frank or Leo, but the film remains a powerful thriller. Mann knows thrills and tension and is not afraid to show it off, as demonstrated in Thief, which truly embodies his trademarks and knowledge of how to leave his audience dying for more."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

The cast had great chemistry with one another and though the characters, plot, and film are absolutely the dumbest I have seen in a while, the energy and aesthetic of the film are undeniably infectious. James Franco turns in a characteristically charismatic performance and really steals the show as a drug dealer who is absolutely hysterical.

Guess that is what happens to those of us who are a few cards away from a full deck. As it stands, the film is truly just an inventive alien invasion flick that doubles as a social critique for how people sit back and do not question what they are told. This, again, is a problem that continues to today where people simply read or hear something and take it as the gospel truth because the person is on the news or sounds like they know what they are saying. They Live is a cautionary tale in this regard as people have been lulled into believing they are safe when, in reality, we are blind to the negative forces all around us that corrupt our minds. In John Carpenter's incredibly inventive and imaginative They Live, those negative forces are aliens."", ""Unaware of what is going on until he puts on some special sunglasses, John Nada (Roddy Piper) quickly sets out to help the resistance expose the control the aliens have achieved. Through cool gadgets such as those sunglasses of the aliens' watches, the film creates some great little science fiction touches that really only add to the experience. In particular, the former creates incredible anxiety. As John gets surrounded by aliens that know he can see, the film takes on an incredibly thrilling and terrifying tone. However, the same can be said for when he has the glasses off. Whenever he is in a tough situation and Carpenter does not immediately have him put on the glasses, the film is packed with tension and paranoia. The film manages to convince you that everybody and anybody could be an alien, especially when he lacks the glasses. When he loses them, the tension and anxiety to put them back on is felt by the audience as our heart races along with John's."", ""Action-wise, the film is incredibly strong. Each action set piece is incredibly strong and Carpenter knows his way around a gun battle. This is very much the case in They Live in which his battles are very similar to ones found in the very beginning of his career, except with more polish and better effects. On that note, the visual effects are very good. The film does a great job crafting the look the aliens and it feels like it is very similar in style in that area to Tim Burton's Mars Attacks!. However, it feels realistic and looks funny at the very least. Carpenter plays on this at the end when the aliens are revealed in bars, having sex, or on television. While comical in look and feel, the aliens do look pretty interesting and feel authentic and an interesting take on what aliens would like and do on earth."", ""They Live could also be categorized as Carpenter being very tongue-in-cheek with his fighting against criticisms towards his use of sex and violence. The ending highlights this with an alien on television saying that he and George Romero need to tone down both. Here, Carpenter essentially compares his critics to being mindless robotic aliens, incapable of formulating their own opinions. Instead, they opt to parrot what they have heard others say. This is unfortunately still prevalent today, especially in film criticism when a popular film or artist's reputation is quickly torn apart after one critic or person makes a short-sighted argument, which then gains steam and popularity. Carpenter had obviously been critiqued for both sex and violence, so he answers with a film built on testosterone and campy violence and action. Honestly, it is admirable to see him fight back in this fashion."", ""They Live is a truly entertaining and campy science fiction horror comedy about a man who wakes up to alien invasion taking place on Earth. While silly, its science fiction pieces are imaginative and truly engaging. It creates a world that is worthy of further looks and is truly fun to imagine the possibilities within this world, especially with the cool knick knacks introduced by Carpenter throughout the film. Action-packed, inventive, and simply a good time, They Live is another top-notch film from John Carpenter."" ]";1;1;1;0;0;0

However, it is an incredibly smart film that aces its satirical goals. The acting is bad, the nudity is unnecessary, and the gore is excessive, but it is fun and has some great special effects. The satirical element, as I said, is great. It really skewers the military industrial complex of our country and the blind loyalty we have towards the military. Honestly, it is not hard to draw comparisons between the depicted conflict and the ones we currently find ourselves in. Thus, no matter how loud and juvenile it can be, this fantastic satire truly elevates it multiple levels for me. Plus, as I said, Paul Verhoeven's films are a guilty pleasure of mine at this point. The aesthetic and visual style he uses is great to me. As a whole, Starship Troopers is very much imperfect, but more than accomplishes the goals it set for itself."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

Now, in terms of films on addiction, this one is much lighter than a film such as Requiem for a Dream and easier to get through for sure (though I do prefer Requiem for a Dream to this one). This \""lightness\"" is thanks to good dark comedy elements and the hopefulness you feel for a better future at different times during the film. However, that does not mean this one is not dark as there are many scenes that are extremely haunting and really make you feel one with the characters as they went through these situations. Ewan McGregor is great in this film, though really the entire cast is phenomenal as everybody pulls their weight equally. Danny Boyle's direction is frenetic and fabolous. In addition, the script is awesome. Every line is dripping with quality. Ultimately, Trainspotting is a great and almost sympathetic and hopeful look at addiction and what causes people to spiral out of control. Really good film."" ]";1;1;1;0;0;0

In a sign of things to come, the film uses an ensemble cast to great effect with phenomenal performances from Mark Wahlberg, Burt Reynolds, Julianne Moore, Heather Graham, Philip Seymour Hoffman, John C. Reilly, Alfred Molina, Thomas Jane, and many others. Truly, Anderson knows how to get the most out of ensemble casts and this film plus Magnolia stand as stunning proof of just that.

His performance as the mentally slow Karl stands tall though as the best thing about this film, though the performances of everyone else here are also top-of-the-line. The characters are perfectly put together and their relationships feels entirely authentic. The film also feels incredibly Southern, which gives it a great authenticity on that front. A touching, well made, and at times thrilling film, Sling Blade is predictable at times and if you do not figure out how this one will end, you need to rewind and watch it again because you are not paying close enough attention.

F. Murray Abraham is great as Mozart's jealous rival Salieri, but to me, the real star here was Elizabeth Berridge, who plays Mozart's wife. In an innocent, vulnerable, strong, and entirely powerful performance, she manages to keep Mozart focused and keep him grounded, while also doing the same for the viewer. She is marvelous here and turns in an entirely enchanting performance. Tom Hulce, who plays Mozart, does well, but his performance is incredibly over the top and that proves to be a bit annoying at times. In no surprise, the music in the film is truly incredible and enrapturing. The production design and costume design are also top of the line. Finally, the direction from Milos Forman is grand in scale and phenomenal. This one was told quite well and really worked on multiple levels.

For the most part, it was relatively tame compared to other films I have seen. In addition, the story was very good and never failed to be completely engrossing. The characters were well crafted and their arcs very interesting to follow. There were a lot of them, sure, but it was never too overwhelming. In addition, the true story aspect of this made the story really work and I can see why Scorsese was drawn to this, as it feels like a very Scorsese film, as thematically it is similar to many of his other works. For the most part, it felt a bit like Goodfellas in a casino, but I did not really mind that. The only thing that really stuck out to me was the narration. I think the story could have been told without it and the narration, at times, could distract from the story.

dracula;9;Spangle;/user/Spangle;Sep 18, 2017;"[ ""A truly horrifying descent in Dracula lore and superstition, Francis Ford Coppola's take on Dracula is far longer than the original 1931 version, yet so much more terrifying to watch. Demonstrating the backstory to Dracula (Gary Oldman) and providing the vicious vampire with more depth and emotional connection than in the original, Coppola allows his central monster to be felt as an extremely human character who only turned to evil as an expression of his incredible pain. With all of the classic characters from Bram Stoker's Dracula popping up throughout this film, Coppola's bloody descent into the very depths of hell set in Transylvania is one that lingers in the air like a dense, blue or green fog. Chilling to one's very soul, Coppola's take on Dracula may be infamous for the poor acting of Keanu Reeves, but it is so much more than anticipated."", ""With Gary Oldman portraying the titular monster, Coppola's take on Dracula is one laced with menace from the very beginning. Sinister, morose, and sadistic, images of Dracula's demonic horde of women seducing Keanu Reeves' Jon Harker or consuming a baby for strength are seared into the very fabric of this film. However, comes after revealing what has sent Dracula into this hellish descent into sin with Satan as his tour guide. Renouncing God and stabbing a crucifix after learning that his enemies had deceived his bride Elisabeth (Winona Ryder) into believing he was dead, which caused her to kill herself, Dracula turns his back on the Lord rather violently and becomes a vampire. Capturing souls for Satan via the seduction of spiritually vulnerable women such as Lucy Westenra (Sadie Frost), Dracula's discovery that Jonathan is set to marry Mina (Winona Ryder) who is a spitting image of Elisabeta is one that sets him on a course for London. Roping her into his world of sin and evil, Dracula is a man who is intent on mending his broken heart and delves into sin, immortality, and violence, as a method of soothing this ache in his now-dead soul. A shockingly tragic figure who, along with his minions, commits abhorrent violence, Dracula is a man who instills fear into the hearts of all those who hear of him and his ways. Yet, through his anguish, he becomes a man who is sympathetic in the sense that he was once a force for good who, through loss, let his soul and sword be used a weapon of Satan."", ""It is through this that the film's demonic exploits work in spite of the controversy surrounding them and why the film's \""love conquers all\"" finale is so powerful. Tempting and using sin as a weapon against their targets, Coppola shows the bare-breasted demonic concubines seducing Jonathan by sliding through his spread legs and presenting themselves for his pleasure. Seducing him into lusting after them and committing a sin of the flesh, the women secure Jonathan's soul via this method. The disorienting camera work from Coppola and the decision to end the scene by showing the women swarm around a baby to drink its blood make the scene one that sends chills throughout the viewer's entire being. Yet, together with the characterization of Lucy as a sinful, worldly, and intensely sexual seductress of the men in her life, the film demonstrates the path by which one's soul is corrupted. Giving into this temptation leaves them open to sin, one which Lucy fully embraces and one that Jonathan stands strong and resists."", ""This descent into hell and corruption of good is demonstrated in Mina as well. At the beginning, she is envious of Lucy. Well-mannered, strict, and hardly a seductress, Mina is shocked to see nude images in a copy of Arabian Nights. When Lucy sees these images, however, she explains to Mina what is going on, giggles, and puts deviously sexual thoughts into Mina's head and expresses her own. Planting these seeds of sin, Mina is set up perfectly for the arrival of Dracula. Unleashing her inner sexual being, he gives her the carnal pleasure she so desires in the scene in which he takes turns her into a vampire. With Jonathan - her husband - unwilling to go into such sexuality even with his wife, she turns to Dracula as the only possible source of this pleasure and the one who makes her feel most in touch with her most forbidden desires. Demonstrating the immediate ecstasy and pleasure garnered from giving into temptation, Dracula quickly shows the downside with Mina expressing immediate regret and guilt over her sin when she collapses into Jonathan's arms after Dracula leaves."", ""It is through this necessary hellish descent into sin that Coppola expresses the soul of Dracula. A torn, broken, and hideously sinful man, he resents God so he corrupts those that would belong to Him. Putting sin, lust, and deceit, into their hearts due to the wrongs that he perceives to have been done to him, Dracula brings the hellish hurt and anguish of his soul onto the Earth in order to spread the pain, hunger, and forbidden lust that he feels in his soul.

Great direction and acting bolster this one greatly, but really, it is the fantastic writing that wraps it all up with a bow, as this one is the complete package. I find Hollywood and the behind the scenes stuff endlessly interesting, so this one is of course going to be in the wheelhouse, but I enjoyed the satirical tone of the film and how it blended with the serious elements of murder.

Trying to escape the media frenzy by going with his daughter Barbara (Calista Flockhart) to meet her fiance Val (Dan Futterman) and his parents in South Beach, little does he know that the press coverage is just starting."", ""Riding high on the comic energy of Robin Williams and Nathan Lane, The Birdcage serves as the perfect vehicle for the duo's physical comedy, especially Lane. Though Williams is a comic legend who nails his role as drag club owner Armond, a far more masculine man, the flamboyantly gay drag queen headliner for the club played by Lane is hysterical. In particular, the film is quite funny when Armond plans to let Albert stay for dinner, but as gay uncle Al who walks and talks like John Wayne. Unfortunately, Albert has his own plan and shows up as Val's mother, even with Val's  female mother on her way to the dinner. While The Birdcage is undeniably cliche, the absurdity of it all and the comedic tour de force of both simply funny lines and physical comedy put on by Williams and Lane is more than enough to lift the film over the hurdles placed in front of it by those cliches."", ""That said, The Birdcage is not all comedy. Instead, underneath its surface, is a message of tolerance and acceptance. In a poignant speech to his son Val, who is hardly an **** himself and just trying to make an ill-fated attempt at a good impression, Armond says that yes he is gay. But, it has taken him a lot of time to get where is and he does not care who sees or whether they accept him or not. Albert, similarly, just wants to be himself. He is the \""mother\"" to Val and incredibly flamboyant, but Lane does a great job showing how awkward acting \""masculine\"" is to him. It is not who he is, nor is it what he wants to be. Even their house maid Agador  Spartacus (Hank Azaria) is who he wants to be and that is a man who speaks with the stereotypical \""gay accent\"" (for lack of a better term) blended with a Guatemalan accent. It is for these portrayals that the film has been called offensive as they come at a time when the world had still not fully accepted homosexuals as equals and, here, it turned them into jokes. But, crucial to understand is that the film preaches a message of choosing one's own path. All of the characters may be various stereotypes, but they own it. Agador even says he talks exactly how he wants to talk. Lane is not mocked for acting feminine, but rather his comedic height in this film is when he tries to act masculine. It is not even just funny because of him acting masculine, but rather because he is not being himself. The film's message of accepting who you are without care for how others perceive you is what saves it from being offensive. The men on display know they are being stereotypical, but it is who they want to be and who they are. Ultimately, who they are does manage to save Kevin Keeley from scandal, which certainly must also count for something."", ""Funny, sweet, and charming, The Birdcage is a film about accepting yourself above all else. It is only when they realize this that things begin to go better and the marriage can go ahead without a hitch. The more they pretended to be somebody else, the more troubles they encountered on the dinner. At the end of the day, everybody seems to realize this and it is what allows everything to go on without a hitch at that point on. That said, the film's portrayal of gay characters and some of the dialogue can certainly be offensive to some, but the film does enough to try and normalize homosexuality and show the benefits of being yourself (especially for 1996) to mostly overcome its own stereotypes. While cliche and a remake, The Birdcage is a comedy film that benefits tremendously from excellently funny turns from Robin Williams and Nathan Lane."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

Yes, it did become a ride at Universal Studios, but it feels more akin to the movie being mere marketing for the ride, rather than the ride coming as a result of the movie. A special effects bonanza, Twister is hardly a good film in the typical sense, but it is a good film in its own way. What saves the film is its sense of purpose and scope. It feels like a blockbuster and one that is unafraid to delve into serious topics in honoring the storm chaser profession with costly special effects. While cliche and derivative, the film powers through them and delivers terrific entertainment that is hardly a mindless blockbuster."", ""Often times, on sites other than Letterboxd, I am accused of hating fun. Big blockbusters are not my thing. Marvel films are hollow parades of predictability and action scenes that exist merely to look cool and show off technology than to actually do anything plot-wise.

The films have just become more like the X Games with guys doing tricks on bikes or the World's Strongest Man re-runs on ESPN with men flexing as they reign in a plane. For those into that, the films are appealing, but it is not my style. Films such as Twister, however, are my style. It special effects, which are tremendous even today, feel built to be experienced first hand. They are a throwback to old school disaster movies with objects flying from every which direction and the characters forced to run to the right and left on a set with real objects, rather than just a green screen. These more stripped down special effects are fun and far more engaging, but also serve a purpose plot-wise. There are no moments where something is thrown in because it looks cool. The twisters are needed. The carnage is needed. Every piece is there because it communicates the scope of these tornadoes and the danger storm chasers find themselves in during the course of their scientific duty. The special effects, therefore, are quite tight and well deployed. This is a film built to impress with great effects, but its effects create well earned tension and thrills that deliver splendid entertainment."", ""The tornadoes, however, are only part of Twister's appeal. It is a blockbuster unafraid to become real. Depicting the real damage of tornadoes, the film develops tremendous stakes.

It would be a life saving discovery and, therefore, essential. This is not some \""save the world from whatever\"" mission, this is a small increase in warning time, but an essential step for the citizens of the area nonetheless. Thus, while the special effects and tornadoes do look quite \""cool\"", they are also weirdly haunting. As they tear across the country side, you can feel the fear and anticipation of the citizens and the storm chasers as it bears down on populated areas throughout Oklahoma. While the film does not develop these random citizens at all (nor should it), the film is blessed with the fact that it is real because it immediately makes the destruction and human suffering feel real. It gives the film great stakes, but also great scope and purpose with the mission these people are on carrying great importance and weight."", ""That said, the film does suffer from its stock characters. From the married couple who used to be partners at work, but are now separated and one having a new spouse who simply does not \""get\"" their passion, the film's romantic center is doomed to be cliche. A loud and obnoxious comic relief stock character, a stock supporting character that will clearly wind up in danger, a bad backstory and family tragedy, a useless \""villain\"", and a typical cast of unrecognizable character actors in small roles that help to chase storms, accompany the film's poor romantic set-up. In focusing on its special effects, Twister did forget to build worthwhile characters, but fortunately, this problem is helped and not by the special effects. Rather, the stakes. We do not need much to root for them. We root against the villain because he is a bad storm chaser who does not listen to advice or words of wisdom. His device will fail to help the people in tornado alley. If Bill (Bill Paxton) and Jo (Helen Hunt) get in the right position, however, they can help because they know what they are doing. Regardless of how one-dimensional they are, director Jan De Bont's aforementioned inclusion of the damage caused by a tornado helps to alleviate issues with the characterization as it gives the audience a cause and group of people to easily root for."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0
unforgiven;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;Nov  2, 2015;"[ ""A beautifully crafted western, Unforgiven is Clint Eastwood working at his very best as a director and an actor. The film is well-paced, well-directed, and well-acted on all accounts, especially Eastwood, Gene Hackman, and Jaimz Woolvet. Freeman is also good here, as is Richard Harris. The cinematography throughout is beautifully done and really captures the Western feel necessary for this one. In addition, the writing is great and the characters are all really well crafted and fleshed out. For as many characters as there were, it was never hard to identify what made them tick. It is not hard to understand why Unforgiven is so well liked by many, as it is definitely one of, if not the, best westerns of recent memory and features a more modern Eastwood reminding us why we love him in the saddle so much. Overall, Unforgiven is a great western film that features all of the elements you love from the best westerns and just presents it to a modern audience."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0
the-bridges-of-madison-county;9;Spangle;/user/Spangle;Mar 10, 2017;"[ ""After watching David Lean's brilliant film Brief Encounter yesterday, it seems like fate that I would encounter Clint Eastwood's The Bridges of Madison County. Though it is possible that Eastwood did not take inspiration from Lean's film, the two are incredibly similar thematically and plot-wise. Portraying two people meeting for a fleeting few days in 1965, this film is a transcendent look at love and denial that is positively heart wrenching. Set in both 1965 and the present day, the film looks at the affair between Francesca Johnson (Meryl Streep) and Robert Kincaid (Clint Eastwood) as it occurs and as it is viewed by Francesca's two children as they learn about it after their mother's death. Both a passionate and mournful look at love, the film is a brilliantly constructed look at relationships."", ""In 1965, Francesca is an unhappy housewife. With her husband and children out of town for a few days, she plans on just getting some time away from them and breathing. However, photographer Robert Kincaid comes to town to take pictures of the bridges of her Iowa hometown for a National Geographic spread. Quickly falling for him, their relationship is brief, just four days, but very much akin to the one in Brief Encounter. Robert is not married to a woman, but is married to his work. Taking him all over the world, he is devoted to the world to the detriment of his relationships with women. Francesca, meanwhile, ditched her dreams long ago to have children. The part of her that would jump and leave at the drop of a hat is long gone, for fear of instilling a bad message to her children. Thus, both know their relationship is doomed. It will end because there are forces beyond their control that pull them away from one another. Yet, as much as it hurts them both, neither wish to forget what they felt over the course of those four days as they, by their own admission, cram a lifetime of passion into just four days."", ""With the relationship defined in small moments - Robert picking her flowers, dancing in the kitchen, taking photos at the bridge, laying in the bathtub, and simply talking at the table - the romance is incredibly authentic. Yet, no moment really rips your heart out akin to the last chance they have to be together in spirit. With her husband Richard (Jim Haynie) home now, Francesca goes into town with him where she sees Robert. Staring at one another in the rain, the film refuses to go for the overly dramatic and unrealistic conclusion. They look at one another, Francesca leans over in the front seat to get a better look at him in the pouring rain, but they go their separate ways. Leaving town, Richard winds up behind Robert. In his truck, Robert can be seen hanging the crucifix Francesca gave him on his rearview mirror and waiting at a green light. He gives her one last chance to come with him. She clutches the door handle and waits. Her worries about Robert no longer wanting her are long gone. The connection is mutual. The experience unique. They are brief soulmates, but Francesca must choose: her family or Robert. In this tense and dramatic scene, the drama feels real. It is not manufactured and you can feel her dilemma. Regardless of what she chooses, she will never feel complete as her heart is guaranteed to be pulled in two separate directions. As is the case throughout, Streep beautifully portrays this complex character and the dilemmas before her. She acts out at Robert for making her feel this way, is set to leave, and is set to stay. She cannot make up her mind, but settles on hurting the least amount of people. Were it not for Streep's powerful performance, the film would still be good but not great. This is the perfect marriage between actor and material as she brings power and grace to the picture, as well as the dilemmas put before her character."", ""One of the film's greatest assets, however, is the portrayal of Francesca's husband. Often times in these films about affairs, the spouse is shown to be boring or abusive or any number of things. Robert, however, is not treated in such a way. He is a great husband and father. On his death bed, he expresses his regret that he never gave Francesca her dreams. His role in the film is moving and powerfully written. A large part of why Francesca stays is to not hurt Richard and it is easy to see why. He is a beautiful soul who never hurt anybody. Why would he deserve to be hurt in such a way by his wife, who he never wronged. Thus, by not portraying him negatively, The Bridges of Madison County brilliantly shows the pull her marriage has on her heart. Had he been portrayed negatively, it would be a mystery as to why she would stay when she was so unhappy. But, due to his characterization, it becomes clear that she stayed because she loved him. She could not hurt somebody she loved for the simple reason that he was not her soulmate. It is a truly selfless act and yet another example of her giving up her dreams for her family."" ]";0;0;0;0;1;0
jfk;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;Feb 27, 2017;"[ ""Spinning an impeccable yarn about the conspiracy theories revolving the assassination of John F. Kennedy, JFK is a captivating, riveting, and truly compelling film. Structured as a bit of a courtroom drama with New Orleans DA Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner) investigating the case, interviewing people with knowledge of the situation, and presenting his case to the jury. While compelling, the film is definitely very long, especially the director's cut. The film does a good job weaving everybody into the final case, while also showing just how hard it was to prove his conspiracy case against businessman Clay Shaw (Tommy Lee Jones) being involved in the assassination of JFK. What Garrison does do, however, is convince the audience of every conspiracy theory possible. Laying out the evidence and painstakingly going though the minutia of details, everything sounds plausible and backed up with incredible evidence. What definitely becomes clear is the fact that there were multiple shooters. While Stone no doubt framed it in that fashion with the details he had, it should just be obvious to anybody knowing about the law of physics in relation to the magical bullet."", ""Powerfully told, smartly written, and excellently acted, the film is anchored by a terrific lead performance by Kevin Costner. The embattled New Orleans DA with a tough home life as a result of his obsession, his home life may be a bit cliched. But while he is interviewing people and pitching his case, Costner is fantastic. The closing monologue as Garrison makes his case to the people is impeccably acted and written with Costner nailing every line, every question, and every moment of that sequence. Stone's direction turns the sequence into the equivalent of a hypnotic episode and Costner slinks right down into it perfectly. He is a terrific lawyer and detective in this film and matches the film's epic quality."", ""However, what truly adds to the film's epic feeling is the supporting cast. Littered in this film are various tremendous actors giving terrific supporting performances. These include, but are not limited to, Jack Lemmon, Joe Pesci, John Candy, Donald Sutherland, Kevin Bacon, Tommy Lee Jones, Edward Asner, Gary Oldman, Laurie Metcalf, and Michael Rooker. The whole cast, from beginning to end, truly nail their roles and add brilliantly to the odd cast of characters linked to the assassination of Kennedy. With each interview sequence being incredibly tense, riveting, and well told, the film finds power in its dialogue that more than entertains. With each interview, it becomes tough to balance everything we have heard in our minds, but Stone is smart to include wrap-up scenes in the DA's office every once in a while where the group find out exactly where they are and what they have that they can use in a courtroom."", ""That said, it becomes clear during the film that people are just not ready. Garrison spins this incredible case that very clearly points to the conspiracy, but he is brick walled throughout by the media. Even though the jury agrees there was a conspiracy behind the murder, the connection to Clay Shaw is tenuous at best relying on sketchy witnesses. But, to uncover the conspiracy behind anything, weeding through what the witnesses say is a must, no matter who they are. People too willingly write off conspiracy nuts as crazy loons, even if some of what they say may be based in fact or covered up fact. Not every inch of conspiracy theories are true, but more than people are willing to admit. JFK shows this incredibly well with even employees in the DA's office expressing doubt about what they have and the horrible witnesses they talked to. That said, the key to understanding the assassination is given X (Donald Sutherland). In a terrific supporting role, Sutherland's mysterious military colonel tells Garrison that the who is just scenery to distract people from the why. Incredibly true, every conspiracy theory falls down when people get down into the who. Often times, there is very little evidence supporting the who or loose connections at best. If people focused on the why and worried about the who later, then maybe something would actually come out of most conspiracy theories."", ""Long, maybe too long, but compelling and a truly unique conspiracy thriller mixed with courtroom drama, JFK is one of director Oliver Stone's best work with an excellent performance from Costner and the whole cast. Easily convincing the audience that there was a conspiracy, it does not pretend to show us the who because it hardly matters who kills Kennedy. Rather, Stone's film painstakingly sets the scene for why and makes a compelling case on that front. Now, it is up to the jury of the audience to figure out whether they believe it or not."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0
the-umbrellas-of-cherbourg;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;Nov  5, 2016;"[ ""Upon hearing comparisons between the works of Jacques Demy and Damien Chazelle's forthcoming musical La La Land, I knew I had to watch some of Demy's work in anticipation of that film. My first - The Umbrellas of Cherbourg - certainly matched and exceeded my expectations. A musical about life, love, and loss, The Umbrellas of Cherbourg is a beautifully written film that is imperfect, but gorgeously crafted. Operatic in style, The Umbrellas of Cherbourg features no grand set pieces nor any single song. Rather, it is written as a typical film would be, except it is sung. The end result is a beautifully written film that may lack true character development, but its music is so brilliantly put together, it is easy to turn a blind eye to its flaws."", """", ""Telling the story of Genevieve (Catherine Deneuve) and her relationship with Guy (Nino Castelnuevo), a man who is set to leave for war in Algeria, The Umbrellas of Cherbourg shows both the dark and light side of love and marriage. Demy's film does not shy away from showing the pain it can cause and the torment it leaves Genevieve with when Guy leaves for war, but the film equally shows the ecstasy and joy. The end result is a sweet film that feels endlessly watchable and thoroughly enjoyable. Though not truly dreamlike - like La La Land has been described - The Umbrellas of Cherbourg does have a certain airy and light feeling to it. This is matched by the largely bright color scheme of the film, which has the impact of making the film feel truly vibrant. This vibrancy is matched the sung dialogue. Had this been a spoken film, it would have lost much of its impact. As it stands, the singing bolsters the beauty of the rest of the film and breathes life into it as a whole."", """", ""However, The Umbrellas of Cherbourg is far from perfect. Though beautifully sung and brilliantly acted - especially by Deneuve - the film's characters leave much to be desired. By the end, it feels as though things speed along too quickly in the story and things just happen. This leaves many dramatic sequences feeling quite hollow and emotionless for the audience, as they are far too sudden to have a true impact. Yet, individually, its characters are terrific. Well-written and able to communicate often without speaking, the film's characters seem incredibly real and authentic both in 1960s France and the modern world."", """", ""Musically, the film is great. All of the actors complete their singing lines terrifically and the score - which is a constant in the background - is fantastic. The music certainly, as mentioned before, contributes to this light, airy, and warm feeling the film radiates. Though the plot can often depict somewhat traumatic experiences for the characters, the film never ceases to be a pleasing and comfortable experience. This is, in large part, thanks to the music that provides a degree of pleasure that escapes explanation."", """", ""As a whole, The Umbrellas of Cherbourg - the first film I have seen by Demy - is a tremendous experience. A romantic musical, the film depicts both the good and the bad side of love with equal passion. The music and the signing are tremendous and wind up covering up the main negative of the film, which is the far-too-quick pacing of the story towards the end of the film that removes much of the emotional impact it could have."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

The direction by David Fincher is fantastic as usual. The cinematography is also gorgeous and perfect for a film of this type. The costume and production design are also pitch perfect, as is the stunning makeup. The makeup is some of the best I have ever seen in a film, honestly. The acting from Brad Pitt, Cate Blanchett, and Taraji P. Henson, is also very powerful and very good. The unique story of a man born old and who gets younger as time goes on, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a touching, brilliantly made film that is a tad long, but never feels as long as it is, especially since you wish there was more to see once the credits start rolling. While the romance elements have been done before, the unique twist thrown in here adds a certain freshness to it that elevates it above your usual romantic film.

Starring an ensemble cast with a tremendous cast of characters in small cameo-esque roles throughout that really add thunder to this film. Over-the-top, stupid, and thoroughly Tarantino, True Romance is an odd little love story with an affinity for guns, unexpected drug dealing, and a whole cast of gangsters, cops, and movie producers, all vying for the coke from an unexpected source. With great acting and writing, the film may be a bit predictable and is thoroughly cliched, but is remains terrific entertainment throughout its runtime."", ""The best scene in the film is the infamous \""Sicilian scene\"" with Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper. It is all we see of Walken's mysterious Don Vincenzo, the consigliere for infamous gangster Blue Lou Boyle, who had his coke accidentally stolen by stupid Clarence (Christian Slater). With the coke worth than $500,000, it should be clear that he is unhappy. Going to Clarence's father Clifford (Hopper), Don Vincenzo gives the man a chance to talk. A raw, tough-nosed conversation, it is a brilliantly eloquent, concise, and written sequence by Tarantino. Naturally, Walken nails the role and is a real highlight of the film as a whole. The nervous energy given off by Hopper, but his solid defiance to this brutally violent man before him is equally terrific. This is a scene that gives Tarantino to spin this crime yarn into something of higher literary significance and he does it, with a gorgeously penned scene. Walken and Hopper do the writing justice, plus some."", ""In a typically chameleon-like performance, Gary Oldman also steals the show as pimp Drexl Spivey. Confronted by Clarence to free Alabama (Patricia Arquette) from his grasp and also the man with the coke from Blue Lou Boyle, Oldman's Drexl is a black man wannabe with a scarred face, one eye, and long brown dreadlocks. This man really is a chameleon. Psychotic, unhinged, and an undeniably wild pimp, Oldman's character may be my favorite from the film, even though Walken's terrific Sicilian gangster gets the best scene in the entire film."", ""Naturally, James Gandolfini is also tremendous in this film as Don Vincenzo's trigger man Virgil. Roughing up Alabama to find out where the coke is, Virgil takes a liking to her and let's her take one shot before he finishes her off. Menacing, tough, and yet warm and oddly approachable like only an oddly good guy Gandolfini can be, the film finds yet another great scene with Galdolfini's moment in the spotlight."", ""The film also finds a great source of energy from Brad Pitt's Floyd. He never really gets a scene to himself, rather he is always a supporting character. That said, he is hysterical as a druggy who is always high. Letting the gangsters know Clarence's every move while offering them drugs the whole time, Floyd is a real gem of a character. No surprise he inspired Pineapple Express given how well he would fit in that film. The best moment with Floyd comes as a gangster pulls a gun causing a delayed, high reaction from Pitt as he mutters, \""Woah.\"""", ""Yet, the stars here are Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette. Less compelling than the rest of the supporting cast, their twisted love story is one only Tarantino could concoct. In essence, it is a dry run for Natural Born Killers without the constantly bloodshed and via the direction of Tony Scott. Thus, it is less coked up and more restrained than Oliver Stone's film. Though less interesting than the other characters, their Bonnie & Clyde-esque matchup of a hooker with a heart of gold and a lonely man with limited romantic experience is somehow charming and sweat. True Romance is a film that violently argues that, to love somebody, you must kill for them. Clarence and Alabama pull the trigger for one another, in the most romantic acts ever and in an attempt to be Elvis (Val Kilmer) cool."", ""Kinetic, insane, and thoroughly Tarantino, the film is not really a Tony Scott film. Yet, his assured hand does help keep it a bit more restrained without descending into complete parody. With a tremendous cast that all nail their roles, True Romance is a very good film that is simply fun and somehow romantic."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

Jesse Eisenberg is very good in the lead role, Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin are also both very strong, and Woody Harrelson was born for this role. Nothing like watching Woody massacre zombies with the kind of glee only he can show, while being oddly vulnerable at the same time. A funny film, the romantic elements do not feel forced, neither do the emotional moments. As gory as a zombie apocalypse needs to be, even the violence manages to be comedic here as they manage to suck every joke they can out of everything going on, which is great. I love when films do that. Overall, Zombieland may not be finding a place in the Library of Congress any time soon, but it is still a very fun and well made film."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

It is hard to pick a standout, since they all stood out. The film is very successful in large part because of those actors, but not solely because of them. The film is slow at times, but never boring, as it manages to keep you hooked all the way through as you attempt to figure out whether the allegations are true or not. One of the films major successes is how it sets up its characters. All are very well developed in a short period of time and you feel like you begin to understand what is going on, but the film manages to keep the \""Doubt\"" alive as the give little bits of information supporting both sides, allowing you to almost never truly figure out if the priest did as accused or not. Really, you find yourself picking sides at times, only to have the film throw you back into questioning once you think you figured it out.

Oliver Platt, Kevin Bacon, Rebecca Hall, and Sam Rockwell, add to the acting talent here with strong supporting turns. The film is very well directed by Ron Howard with the pacing and occasional docudrama style being a perfect fit for this type of film. The film really feels fresh and engaging due to this style as the film really ropes you in and brings you into the 1970s. The film is very well paced, which is easy to pick up on. As the premise could have been quite boring, the good pacing makes itself apparent when the film is never boring. Instead, it leaves you wanting more and on the edge of your seat waiting to see where the interview ends up. Overall, Frost/Nixon is exactly what a political drama should be.

This feature combined with True Detective cement Fukunaga as a young director to watch. The cinematography is great and the story is very well developed and well told. The character development here is also very interesting. The growth of many of the characters in the film is as beautiful to watch as it is depressing. Ultimately, this is a immigration tale set against the violent gangs that dominate much of Honduras and some of the other Central American nations.

Like all Tarantino fare, we get our stylized violence, our pitch black comedy, and of course our closeup of an actress' foot (Diane Kruger here). Also, we get a great film. A close second place for me behind Pulp Fiction in terms of Tarantino, Inglourious Basterds features great cinematography and great acting, namely from Christoph Waltz, who absolutely killed it. Brad Pitt was also great and quite hilarious, to boot. From the onset of the film, Waltz' performance takes center stage as we watch him do what he does best: hunt Jews. We then see the same from his counterpart, Pitt, who is great at killing Nazis. These first two parts of the film really setup the film incredibly well for the final act, where spoilers. In addition to Waltz and Pitt, the whole cast did exceptionally well, in partucular Melanie Laurent and Diane Kruger. Michael Fassbender, Daniel Bruhl, and shockingly, Mike Myers, all have good turns as well. Throughout the film, there are many different genres being used terrifically. Of note, the comedic elements were great, in particular the scene in which Pitt attempts to speak Italian. These moments of comedy help to lighten the mood against the hyper violence that takes place (though never too dusturbing, typically the stuff depicted would bother me more, but Tarantino is so stylish, he gets away with it). However, the film also includes many thrilling/suspenseful scenes where your heart is in your throat as you await what happens, while coupling that with elements of war, drama, adventure, action genres, all of which used very artfully and really help to add to the general entertainment of the film."", """", ""On the negative side, the final part is a tad over the top. It came off as extremely odd and slightly off putting. However, the impact on the viewer is certainly still great and any over the topness is not a major complaint, rather something small that bugged me a little bit.

The writing is spectacular as is the direction and when the characters feel hurt, so does the audience. This is largely thanks to the great acting from George Clooney, Anna Kendrick, and Vera Farmiga. However, the true success of the film comes from how real it all feels. It never feels fake and it almost feels as though you are watching a documentary about these regular people. In addition, it was very timely with its release, as it focuses on a guy who fires people for a living and came out in 2009. On the topic of starting over, the film does a very good job and portrays these people with a lot of compassion and honesty.

Starting with the brutal rape and murder of a woman, Liliana Coloto (Carla Quevedo), the film introduces our detective: Benjamin Esposito (Ricardo Darin). Writing a novel about the case 25 years after it happened, Esposito is a man who has never let go of this case. After the convicted killer escaped his clutches, Esposito continues to track him while forging an never-to-be romance with his boss, Irene (Soledad Vallamil). Along the way, he interacts with Liliana's widowed husband, Ricardo Morales (Pablo Rago). As the film likely indicates through the title, the eyes are very important, as well as passion. A thing a person is passionate is something they can never let go. This is a major focus of the film, with much of the story being told through the eyes. Irene and Benjamin are passionate about one another and can never let each go, no matter how much time has passed. Ricardo is passionate about Liliana and cannot let her go as he seeks revenge for his wife's brutal death. The murderer is passionate about Liliana. These passions are through the eyes with Ricardo identifying the killer because of the look in his eyes in a photo and he can tell Ricardo's passion and anger simply by looking into his eyes. Here, the film is incredibly smart and really takes to the heart the belief that the eyes are the window to the soul."", ""One of the best features of the film, however, is the way in which it does not focus on the crime. By the halfway point, we know the killer. Yet, the film continues to have tricks up its sleeves and keeps you guessing all the way to the end. By the time the film ends, it leaves you shocked with its subtle brutality and the horrifying nightmare experienced by its character. The story here is really in the details and require complete attention throughout to be able to follow all of the moving parts. Thus, it is a film that would certainly benefit from a rewatch in order to pick up on all of these intricacies. Using a color-palette of browns, golds, and some grays, The Secret in Their Eyes feels both warm and passionate. Campanella uses the connotations of these colors to create a haunting atmosphere that feels omnipresent in the film and never really ceases. Though brown is typically a color of comfort, he uses it in such a way that nothing ever feels comfortable. Esposito walking to a crime scene or in the house leaves you with great anxiety, even if browns are a major color in these moments. At the very least, these colors work very well together the film is incredibly appealing to the eyes. With this great blend of colors, the film captures the nostalgic and melancholy nature of the film as Esposito is filled with regret over his love life and the crime, with nostalgia for a time when he had Irene and could have had a life with her."", ""Acting-wise, the film is equally terrific. Darin turns in a great performance in the lead role, capturing the stolid nature of his character as well as the internal tormented soul. As the film focuses on the eyes, his eyes are great here and really reveal the true nature of his character. Pablo Rago is also great in a smaller role here as he captures the depression and passion of Morales, the widowed husband. By the end, his performance stands as being one of the more haunting roles in the film and leaves a great impression along the way."", ""Overall, The Secret in Their Eyes is a great film. Haunting, tragic, and thrilling, the film uses a great color scheme to create an odd warmth for its tale of passion. Exceeding the trappings of the crime mystery genre, the film never plays it safe and instead rises above cliches and keeps you guessing throughout. At no point is the film's tragic conclusion predictable, but it is certainly fun to watch it all come together with the film showcasing all of its little subtle hints that led to this finale."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

Though director Spike Jonze obviously incorporates all elements from the book, he instills his own world view and experiences upon the book. The end result is a truly passionate and stirring look at childhood and a young boy dealing with many issues (abandonment, lack of empathy, etc) but through his interactions with these beasts, he learns how to improve himself. Impressively scripted and told, Where the Wild Things Are is a truly imaginative and inspired take on Maurice Sendak's famed children's book. That said, it is likely not a children's movie. A few sequences are quite scary and the amount of adult emotion and reflections on childhood will likely go over many children's heads. That said, I loved this one. The star here is Spike Jonze who really crafts a truly personal film here and this is quite apparent in his gentle handling of the film. Overall, though not a children's movie, Where the Wild Things Are is a very good realization of a staple of many's childhood."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

Tense and thrilling, there are rarely films nowadays that leave me on the edge of my seat, but Green Zone made me think I was going to have a heart attack - it was that thrilling and energizing. The film, politically, has been criticized as \""anti-American\"". I am not seeing it. If anything, it is pro-understanding. Those who try to learn more instead of sticking their head in the sand are rewarded. Those who put down dissenters are villains. That said, the film's simple point of, only Iraqis should run Iraq is very well built up to and a fair point. With so many factions in Iraq, nobody is better equipped to handle running the country than them. We certainly know that now. As for Green Zone, it is a terrifically entertaining and thrilling action war film that is wonderfully directed by Paul Greengrass and his action muse Matt Damon."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

All of the characters here feel authentic and the actors all really capture the essence of the characters and what they represent on the larger scale. On the whole, this is what makes the film so great; it feels like a slice of life type film.

In addition to their general acting ability, director John Wells does a good job making us feel compassion for the three highly privileged characters and turns them into really tragic figures for a variety of reasons. Additionally, the story has been called mundane, but to me, it was very briskly paced and never really slacked. It did a good job generating drama and, honestly, thrills, as you waited to see what occurred in certain scenes. Essentially, The Company Men is a mildly uplifting, but largely moving display of how we need to shed the shackles placed on us by our jobs and find something that we are truly passionate about.

Edgar Wright's style is very abrasive here, since he basically just made it a video game/comic book that was made into a movie, but it really has a very cool and unique look to it that really made the film true eye candy at times. The characters are all pretty well written, though there are some things that really did not work writing wise and I do wish the script was better at different times. The acting was very good from everyone, really loved Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Anna Kendrick here, in particular.

Regardless, it does manage to be uproariously funny at times and had me in stitches at a few times. The voice cast, including Johnny Depp, Isla Fisher, Ned Beatty, Abigail Breslin, Alfred Molina, Bill Nighy, and Timothy Olyphant, is splendid and really knocks the ball out of the park.

In terms of the story itself, the film was very cute and charming as we follow the events that transpire for this kid living in the train station. The acting was also pretty good.

Throughout, we follow the clearly disturbed Nina, played by Natalie Portman, who absolutely kills it here. Her descent into madness is beautifully constructed and portrayed by Aronofsky as it almost makes us feel as though we are going insane right along with her. Mila Kunis and Vincent Cassel also have good supporting roles here. The only thing against this one was that it was a little slow going in the beginning, however, once it really kicks in high gear, it is completely engrossing as you follow every twist and turn and try to wrap your head around what you just watched.

Rather, the film decided to take a lighter approach to cancer, which is appreciated. While it still hit you with the true emotion and the pain and suffering as necessary, it tried to lighten the mood throughout, which is why Seth Rogen is perfect here. As a comic, he really brought his A game here and served as a perfect foil to the subject as a whole. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is fantastic here, as are Anna Kendrick, Philip Baker Hall, and Anjelica Huston. Huston played the mother perfectly and really felt authentic as the mother of a cancer victim.

Blessed with a great concept and very interesting design for the future, Looper has some great direction and writing from Rian Johnson. Looper has some very good action sequences, but its real strengths are from its heady science fiction thrills and from the emotional impact it has on you. In addition, it also has some interesting things to say on the nature of evil in our world, as well as the importance of family and love. When it comes to the time travel feature of the film, it is not afraid to raise questions about what time travel really means. Do things keep repeating and we are powerless to stop them? Are we able to change our futures by altering our pasts? These questions are a few of many that come up, but for a major motion picture, Looper certainly is risky, not just in its willingness to test its audience, but in the fact that it was made at all. Thankfully, it paid off in spades and did quite well financially, but most importantly, it is a really great film.

When I saw Drive for the first time in 2013, I had just finished my first film class in high school and was set to graduate from high school in a few weeks. Now, a week and a half removed from finishing college a semester early, it was time to atone for the sins of my youth. Unacquainted with good films at the time aside from the ones I saw in my class, I was ill-prepared for Drive. Finding it too violent and boring, I previously gave this film a 1/10. I know. The first of many rewatches from 2011 (Contagion, Source Code, The Ides of March, and The Artist are crying out for a re-evaluation), my second viewing of Drive was far more rewarding. Slow, elegant, and poetic, Drive is a remarkably brilliant film with great cinematography, a killer score, great dialogue, and great performances."", ""While I was wrong about this movie originally, I was right that it is incredibly violent. Not for the weak of heart (read: 2013 me), Drive is typical when it comes to Nicolas Winding Refn with its violence. With a violent hatred for people with eyes, Refn takes pleasure in having his films show people get stabbed in the eyes. Here, he also adds in a lot of stabs to the neck and a head being smashed like a watermelon dropped on a sidewalk. Thus, Drive is a hyperviolent film that turns violence into an art form. For example, the scene in the elevator where The Driver (Gosling) moves Irene (Carey Mulligan) out of the way and kisses her as the lights dim, is elegantly crafted and almost mystical in its movement. Juxtaposing the beauty of this movement with the swift violent kicks of The Driver into the would be assailant's face is both jarring and disturbingly gorgeous. Refn is into cheap violence. Instead, his is well shot and purposefully carried out with each swing of a blade or fist carrying significant purpose and elegance."", ""What certainly complements this gorgeous choreography of violent moments is the synth-filled score from Cliff Martinez and the stunning cinematography. Put together, this trio turns Drive from a violent neo-noir crime film into a dream-like whirlwind of gorgeous images and sounds. The film undeniably formalistic in this sense, often using the hyperreality of Los Angeles to escape the boundaries of reality and transcend into being both a dream and a piece of art. At all times, the viewer it is a film due to the techniques utilized by Refn that do not replicate reality. Instead, the techniques serve the purpose of shining beautiful neon lights over a cruel and wicked world. Accenting this is the dialogue of the film, which is minimalist at best. Poetic and purposeful, the dialogue flows brilliantly even if there are large gaps between deliveries. There is a certain lyricism to conversations here, such as those between The Driver and Irene. Though he speaks very little, The Driver is incredibly well developed. Do not mistake his silent nature for weakness as he is actually a menacing, smart, and calculated figure. His every move is precise and chosen carefully. The only time where he takes risks is with Irene. A well-written relationship, the chemistry between The Driver and Irene works, even if given very little screentime. In the time they are given - namely when they go to the river - the writing allows the duo to be a great couple. Stylistically, Refn highlights the almost holy nature of this relationship repeatedly throughout the film. Often when they are together, such as at the river and in the elevator, the film spills a light from above on them that gives them an almost golden glow. Mirroring the brightness they bring to each other's lives, which are otherwise shrouded in darkness, these are the brightest shots of the film and this is clearly purposeful."", ""As The Driver, Ryan Gosling is tremendous. Cool, laid back, and intense, Gosling brings his charms and charisma to the film in a subtle way. Though he is quiet and does not use his mouth, his presence exudes something his words could never capture. As Irene, Carey Mulligan is typically brilliant. Though she is not given much to work with - as this is largely Gosling's show - her brief moments on screen are careful and reserved. She is as withdrawn as The Driver, but equally brings a certain passion and innocence to her scenes. The supporting cast, which includes Bryan Cranston, Oscar Isaac, Albert Brooks, and Ron Perlman, are equally great. As gangsters, Brooks and Perlman are cold, malicious, and brutal. However, they are still written with this odd sort of poetry and romanticism for the bruality they can deliver on those that do them wrong."", ""As with the rest of his neon trilogy, Nicolas Winding Refn gets great pleasure of watching beautiful people do horrific things. Here, Gosling is a mentally unhinged getaway driver whose looks and charisma juxtapose the violence he commits."" ]";0;0;0;0;1;0
sinister-2012;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;Oct 14, 2015;"[ ""This one has jump scares, but good jump scares. Too often, bad horror films will rely on jump scares that startle more than they do scare. However, in Sinister, it does a fantastic job crafting an eerie and fully unsettling atmosphere thanks to a great back story, mysterious happenings, and the phenomenal score (did I mention the score?). Sinister is successful because it does not rely on these scares, rather it is the atmosphere that keeps you on edge and thrills you throughout. Ethan Hawke and the rest of the cast do a good job, but really, this shows director Scott Derrickson truly does have talent. With this atmospheric and creepy horror film, any claims to the opposite can be disregarded. A truly haunting experience, Sinister works well not only as a horror film, but as a crime film with a truly captivating story behind it that you try and piece together along with Hawke. If this film does not scare you, I truly envy you, because I was petrified from the very beginning."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0
mud;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;Mar 31, 2014;"[ ""Charming, sweet, touching, heartfelt, and tragic, Mud is a successful film for many reasons, one of which is the acting. It is hard to think of an actor more on top of his game than Matthew McConaughey and Mud is no exception. His charisma and easy going demeanor really pull you in and, while he is not directly the protagonist (even though he plays the title character), you find yourself rooting for him and hoping things work out for him. On top of McConaughey, both Tye Sheridan and Jack Lofland did fantastic jobs. For actors of their age, they packed considerable emotion and passion into their roles and really impressed me. Also, the supporting cast, headed by Sam Shepard was also phenomenal and really helped. While Fargo is a superior film, a lot of Mud reminded me of Fargo. While it was a totally different film, the way the film totally embodies the region it depicts and sort of oozes with Southern charm is very similar to the way Fargo really represents Minnesota. Both are also beautifully filmed. Fargo's imagery really helped to define it, especially with the blue/white colorization, while Mud's visuals have the same effect, but with golden light on it as if it was shot in \""the magic hour\"" a la Terrence Malick's Days of Heaven."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

Sporting a well-written script packed with drama, laughs, mild romance, charm, and just enough adolescent angst, The Way Way Back is a very well done coming of age drama. Liam Jones is great in the lead role, though often outshined by Sam Rockwell, who is absolutely impeccable here in a role that exudes charisma and charm and was truly meant for him, without question. Toni Collette, Steve Carell, and AnnaSophia Robb are also all very good in this one, though really the whole cast brings their A game. The film is well directed and well told for the most part and really has very few faults. While the romantic elements can seem cheesy and it does break no new ground, that is is not really a negative to me, as it does strike a chord at moments and makes you laugh at others. Really, I cannot ask for much else from a film. This one works from every angle."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

The direction from Richard Linklater is yet again spectacular and the acting from Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are once more perfection. Whereas the first two films, I believe, were largely optimistic, this one does paint quite a sad portrait of love as you age. Yet, in many respects, I think it is still a beautiful picture. It is a film that shows difficulties in relationships and leaves nothing out. However, the way in which it walks it back and shows the tender moments in the aftermath of war, it illustrates that though it can be messy and hurt, love is worth fighting for and the blood, sweat, and tears, spent in the pursuit of it are not in vein. For this, Before Midnight is the best of the trilogy, though they are hard to separate, since all three are such great films. Just as natural and brilliant as the first two, Before Midnight is incredibly satisfying."" ]";1;1;1;0;0;0

Really cool look to this one to go with the great feel. Finally, and most importantly, it is legitimately scary. From beginning to end, it makes you feel a sense of dread and provides enough scares to cause you to jump six feet in the air far too many times. The Conjuring stands tall as one of the best recent horror films and, undoubtedly, one of the scariest films ever made, in large part thanks to it relying on the same types of scares to the table that its predecessors do. In many ways, The Conjuring is the 2010s introduction to brilliant, non-cheesy, supernatural horror."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

It is so adorable, moving, and emotional, I would truly have to be soulless not to be swept up in its beautiful portrayal of life and its perfect imperfections. This film is truly a delight in every definition of the word. Domhnall Gleeson and Rachel McAdams have incredible chemistry and are so adorable it truly caused me physical pain. The film made me laugh, cry, and smile, all at the same time for its depictions of love and of loss, especially given the situation of the film. It may be super sentimental and is certainly guilty of squeezing every last tear out of you purposely, but dammit if I would not love to cry while watching this one again. Endlessly watchable and overflowing with unadulterated charm, About Time redefines delightful cinema and makes me willingly blind to its own flaws, just as I should be in life."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

In many ways, that is what makes this film so successful. It is confusing as all get out, then it shows a little \""hint\"" and then as that sinks in, you realize that that may not be the answer we were looking for. Ultimately, it is a film of decisions and how those decisions will change the course that our lives take. From a technical standpoint, the cinematography is great and Jaco Van Dormael is able to really create some interesting things with this film without question and really helps you to feel sympathy and happiness and then symapthy and then happiness over-and-over throughout the film.. On top of that, Jared Leto is great as always in the lead role."", """", ""In terms of negatives, the confusion is one of them. I love the confusion, but at times, it goes too far and you are left sitting there thinking \""really?\"".

Cate Blanchett was absolutely stunning here, as were Sally Hawkins and Bobby Cannavale. All of them really outdid themselves and turned in phenomenal performances. As with all Allen films, it is more-or-less a slice of life kind of film, so it will only appeal to you if that is up your alley. Fortunately, for me, it is. I am fine with not being told everything and not getting all the answers in return for fantastic characters. Blue Jasmine delivers that in spades with real human beings left-and-right who are multi-dimensional and, as a result, their problems become endlessly relatable and touching. Blue Jasmine is a film that could very reasonably cause the tears to flow. Overall, this character-driven comedy-drama is a force to be reckoned with."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

This was the first film by Alexander Payne I had ever seen and I regret taking this long to start work on his filmography. The cinematography here is gorgeous and serves as the perfect backdrop to this one, as the camera really finds every inch of beauty in this rural setting and maximizes on it. The black-and-white is also a major plus for me, as it just seems to fit. Overall, this one is a story about a man's relationship with his aging father, who certainly seems to have lost a step over the years, but even then, they were never very close. However, when his father hinks he won a million dollars, they start getting closer and he learns more and more about his dad, bringing them closer together. Ultimately, this study of their relationship is entirely endearing to viewers of all ages and if it does not touch your heart, you better head to the doctor to see if you even have one.

First off, like all Wes Anderson films, it has a very distinctive look, which is endlessly gorgeous, but I think this one is the most beautiful of his works for me. Every set piece, every costume, every shot, every everything, was absolutely breathtaking. I would be hard-pressed to find a shot that is not beautiful. The amount of symmetry in practically every shot was also very impressive and shows you how much work was put into this one. One thing that differentiaties this one from other works of his that I have seen is how the exterior shots of buildings (such as the hotel) look almost animated from a distance even though they are obviously not. It was a very odd, yet awesome touch. On top of the beauty of the film, it is absolutely hilarious. Ralph Fiennes makes for a hilarious main character (not really the lead) and there were so many scenes with him that were absolutely hilarious. I honestly never expected to laugh as much as I did, but this was easily the funniest Anderson film I have seen yet. On top of these positives, the story was incredibly engrossing and never really caused me to lose any interest, as there was no real lull in the film.

Things happen for no reason, things come and go, and things fall apart out of thin air, just like real life. This film is extraordinary for many reasons, one of which has to be the way it was filmed. You do not see films made over the course of 12 years and to see this only helps it be all more powerful. As we grow up with the actors throughout the film, you truly feel like you are almost watching a documentary on these people's lives, which is an incredible feeling .In addition, it just felt unique and was amazing to watch unfold. In addition, it does not try to create drama. Life is not perfect and things happen randomly, people drift off for no reason at all and you have no idea why and you never see them again. This film is exactly like that and makes no attempts to \""Hollywood\"" things up by tying up all the loose ends, instead it leaves them as is. Plus, one cannot forget that this isn't their whole story; this is only a 12 year period in their lives. Who knows where their stories will end up? The writing is incredible, as is the direction from Richard Linklater, who is a true visionary and has undoubtedly created his magnum opus with this project. The acting from Ellar Coltrane, Patrica Arquette, Ethan Hawke, and the only cast, is incredible. The chemistry and familiar relationships felt so real and authentic. The situations rang true and ultimately made this one feel as though the most authentic coming of age film I have ever seen. There were no one dimensional characters and everyone had a story to tell, just like in real life."", """", ""Above all though, I have to say one of the best parts of this film has to be the quotes, in particular one that stood out to me, \""I thought there'd be more.\"" Just impeccable writing that manages to sum up what it is to be at that point so well, although I personally have not gotten there, I can sympathize with that line and its meaning. Ultimately, Boyhood deserves the accolades bestowed upon it and is one of the best films of 2014 and will undoubtedly be hailed as a film for the ages. Wow."" ]";0;0;0;0;1;0
interstellar;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;Nov 29, 2014;"[ ""There are many things here in Interstellar that work very well and some that...fall short. However, as a whole, Interstellar is a major success. First off, the visual effects are...breathtaking. It owes a lot to films like 2001: A Space Odyssey, especially some of the visual splendor that was on screen, but there was certainly some influence from lesser known films such as The Fountain. Some of the sequences in that film are almost perfectly emulated here, with some obvious changes, but the influence is obvious in that sense. Many of the sci-fi elements are also indebted to films such as 2001 and other far-reaching and technically brilliant sci-fi films. Sci-fi film wise, this one travels very little new ground. The score here by Hans Zimmer is perfect and truly served as a great sonic backdrop for the visual ecstasy that was taking place on screen. Interstellar is also a very emotional film, brought to life by strong writing and, in particular, strong acting. Matthew McConaughey is brilliant, as are Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Michael Caine, Casey Affleck, and Matt Damon. They all play great emotional roles here and it is hard to fight back tears at times. There are a ton of brilliant elements here contained here and the space visuals are king of that, but I do feel the story faltered at times. Namely, the ending seemed...cop outish. They kind of a held your hand a little bit at the end and pointed directly at what you needed to understand. It also ended very sentimentally and it could have gone in a far different direction and, to me, the ending seemed fake. Finally, there are some things that just do not make sense in terms of plot (plotholes, somewhat) that are not overly important because I barely remember them already, but all the same. In terms of science, it also seemed to try and go too far and get technical with science stuff, which was unnecessary and, largely, out of mental grasp, which was a bummer."", """", ""Overall, Interstellar is an astounding achievement technically and visually, though it is far from perfect and rather than blasting it for its imperfections, I think perfections need to be celebrated thanks to the profound impact have on the viewer and kind of leave in a trance as the final credits start rolling."" ]";2;3;2;1;0;0
mr-mrs-smith;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;Jan  6, 2017;"[ ""One of my favorite sub-genres has to be the high budget adult action comedy. Unfortunately, it is mostly dead nowadays aside from the release of films such as The Nice Guys this year. They do not resort to low brow humor, put the characters in adult situations, and are perfect examples of the fact that even adults can appreciate some well executed explosions. Plus, there is just something right about Angelina Jolie in a dominatrix outfit snapping a guy's neck. In Mr. & Mrs. Smith, director Doug Liman takes a married couple and makes them both assassins who have been contracted to kill one another. With well executed action set pieces and great comedy, the film's appeal largely rides on it being about a married couple assigned to kill one another. As such, they try to outwit and outsmart another while doing doing so as a married couple living in the suburbs, thus they fight about curtains, comment about homegoods stores, eat bad dinners together, and the man breaks stuff in the house accidentally. For many, this humor may become tiresome, but it always felt fresh and acted as a larger comment on marriage, rather than just a source of comedy."", ""Pairing together Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie in the film that brought them together, Mr. & Mrs. Smith depicts a married couple that is going through a rough patch. With a lack of sex and chemistry at the time, the duo are having troubles. What better way to fix a marriage than by blowing up your home and trying to kill one another in the process? Honestly, it seemed pretty cathartic and makes you wonder why more couples do not try this strategy out. While a bit absurd, Liman laces the action and silly plot with witty and quick jabs and banter between the couple. As a result, their antics become incredibly endearing and deeply funny. Of course, this would not be possible without top-notch performances from Pitt and Jolie who not only have great chemistry with one another, but have tremendous charisma."", ""Of course, it is hard to defend this film. Inherently stupid and over-the-top, Mr. & Mrs. Smith is hardly a classic. That said, it is a terrific blend of action and comedy. For somebody that has been accused of hating fun, this review should defeat those accusations. At the end of the day, I like good action and good comedy. If an action scene thrills me and jokes make me laugh, then I am satisfied. While its gags are silly and it has far too many explosions, its tongue-in-cheek action scenes that parody marriage, relationship warfare, and other action films, it was hard to not fall into the film's charm. Its jokes are well-written, smart, and incredibly witty. They may be a bit silly, but they are never trying too hard, being raunchy for the sake of being raunchy, or giving into lowest common denominator type humor (Deadpool or Kingsman as negative examples here). Instead, it takes an adult approach and finds  a balance in appealing to both adults and action junkies along the way. Hardly the pinnacle of cinema, Mr. & Mrs. Smith is a fun, well plotted, funny, and action-packed summer action flick. With top-notch performances from the always charismatic Brangelina, the film has a lot of fun with its over-the-top action, well-timed comedy, and smart/witty jokes. Gleefully boisterous and absurd throughout, the film's pacing is excellent and keeps the speed at cruise control. It is never distractingly fast, nor is it ever too slow. Instead, it flies by at the right speed to allow full enjoyment of its infectious energy and joy. While many do not like Mr. & Mrs. Smith, count me as one of its supporters, though its flaws are certainly readily apparent and the film is hardly as well manicured as its stars."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

Instead, I saw it as a compelling film with interesting characters and thoughtful ruminations on survival, religion (especially during turmoil), romance, and relationships. Brilliantly directed by Craig Zobel, this one deserves more attention than it has received, especially because of the gorgeous cinematography and fantastic acting from Margot Robbie, Chiwetel Ejiofor, and Chris Pine. Z for Zachariah is a compelling human drama and character study that avoids falling into the stereotypes of the post-apocalyptic genre. Honestly, I never found it to be slow, though its pace certainly is quite assured and deliberate. If you enjoy films about people and do not mind films that are more subtle, Z for Zachariah is for you. A thrilling, moving, and truly enjoyable experience, Z for Zachariah is more than worth your time."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

The film is sort of like that person you are romantically involved with who you love, but they refuse to let you in and there is this distance between the two of you and an air of mysteriousness. This film, if you were try and touch it, would squirm away disgustingly, but then come and hug you instead. Queen of Earth feels influenced by The Shining to me, just in the general feeling it gave, not necessarily in plot because story-wise they have no similarities. However, the general feeling it gave me was similar and also the fact they both portray a descent into madness against the backdrop of a vacation spot. I feel as though this film drove me crazy, as I found myself dying of laughter as it ended, but confused as to what I found so funny. A brilliantly crafted and wonderfully odd and disturbing psychological thriller, Queen of Earth features great performances from Elisabeth Moss and Katherine Waterston, as well as great direction from Alex Ross Perry. Though I love it and immediately wanted to watch it again after it ended, this is truly a film I would never recommend to anybody."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

This film is incredibly powerful all thanks to the masterful work of director Lenny Abrahamson. How somebody can create a film so briliantly moving and beautiful I will never know. Truly a wonderful job on his part. Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay are both stunning and have fantastic chemistry as mother and son. In addition, the writing is fantastic.

Yes, it is a gothic romance, but with it blending so many different genres on top of that, it is certainly hard to fit into any circle. That being said, I am more than happy to let it be on its own and just sit back and enjoy. Thanks to truly beautiful visuals, Crimson Peak absolutely soars and confirms my love of Guillermo del Toro's films. It can be truly violent a couple of times and does manage to scare on a couple of occasions, but its usage of ghosts in a non-scary role is truly brilliant. The design of the supernatural elements is great and they are certainly metaphorical of something, but I am personally having trouble placing my finger on what. Though it is not scary, the film manages to still be deeply unsettling thanks to the great performance of Jessica Chastain. Mia Wasikowska and Tom Hiddleston were also particularly strong here. There are numerous things that stand out to me beside these things, including the symbolic usage of bugs, the brilliant costume design, and the fantastic production design. The whole lore of the mansion, the explanation of the name, and my God the visuals. I know I mentioned the visuals, but the cinematography and visual effects were absolutely phenomenal. Those alone are worth the price of admission. Crimson Peak will ultimately be looked down upon for not being scary thanks to a horrific marketing campaign, even though its intent is not to scare you, which is truly tragic because it is a wonderful film that is masterfully directed by del Toro and has a powerhouse performance from Chastain."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

Consistently poignant, Zootopia's sole weakness comes in the form of it being mildly heavy handed at times. Without that, the film would be nearly perfect. The animation is beautifully brought to life and the voice acting is incredible across the board. Ginnifer Goodwin, Jason Bateman, Idris Elba, and Nate Torrence, being the absolute standouts on that front. They all brilliantly bring their characters to life with their great work. Additionally, the writing is stupendous. Consistently funny throughout, the characters are also well developed and the plot is compelling and interesting, yet still accessible enough for a child. That being said, the jokes (DMV, etc.) may go way over the heads of children. If I were a child, I would find it way less funny than I did as an adult. That said, Zootopia is a fantastic film that starts off Disney Animation's 2016 with a bang and sets a high bar for their release later this year. Wonderfully thoughtout and thoroughly entertaining, Zootopia is another great film to add to Disney's extensive catalog."" ]";2;4;2;2;0;0

From the brilliant walk-out music (the great soundtrack in general), the training, and absolutely stunning fight choreography and cinematography, Creed has it all. The non-boxing parts can feel a bit disjointed at times and then of course it has classic Rocky cheese, but it does enough to honor the original, while going out on its own. Ultimately, the fight for respect faced by Adonis \""Donnie\"" Creed is a similar one faced by the film as a whole. Fortunately, it is entirely successful in forging its own legacy thanks to the fantastic direction from Ryan Coogler (I would be hard pressed to name a better new director right now) and phenomenal performances from Michael B.

black-mass;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;Sep 19, 2015;"[ ""Overall, Black Mass is a good film largely elevated by the acting. While Scott Cooper's direction is tight and taut of the film as a whole, he does his best work bringing out the best in his cast. Just like his previous films, the acting is where it soars. Johnny Depp is stellar, Joel Edgerton is fantastic, while the rest of the cast highlighted by Benedict Cumberbatch, Dakota Johnson, Jesse Plemons, David Harbour, Peter Sarsgard, Rory Cochrane, Adam Scott, Brad Carter, and Juno Temple, are all also great in the film. Truly, no one does a bad job, but those are just the ones who stood out to me the most. Yeah sure, I named most of the cast. Sue me. The film's writing is also very good and it does a great job telling the story of Whitey Bulger and shows his multiple sides; the friend, the father, the husband, and the ruthless killer. Great at capturing the visceral terror inspired by Bulger and the sense of fear surrounding him like  a black cloud, the film does a great job capturing the atmosphere needed. Another major strength of the film is the makeup. Both Depp and Plemons' transformations stand out the most, but they are truly remarkable and unrecognizable in their roles, while becoming their character looks-wise (and acting-wise). Finally, the costume design was also very good and looked the part. Overall, Black Mass is a very good gangster biopic. There are far better gangster flicks and far better biopics, but not many films have such a fantastic cast from top to bottom that knock all of their roles out of the park."" ]";0;1;0;1;0;0

Matt Damon is fantastic, as is the entire ensemble cast, namely Jessica Chastain, Jeff Daniels, and Chiwetel Ejiofor. The film is brilliantly directed by Ridley Scott who's return to science fiction is most certainly a welcome one, as he manages to perfectly manage the blending of Mark Watney's colorful personality with the hard science, without getting bogged down in the details. I would also be remiss if I did not mention the breathtaking cinematography. The shots taking place on Mars and in the ship are perfection, as are the visual effects, which are truly stunning. One of the best science fiction films of the century, The Martian is an enjoyable, masterfully made, and visually spectacular, film that deserves its praise and will hopefully net some additional recognition for its star, who turns in one of the best performances of his career."" ]";0;1;0;1;1;0

Impeccably shot and acted, the beauty of Equals comes at the very end and is what cements it as a good film. Though initially derivative in premise, the film does not focus in on the science fiction. Rather, it is a stripped back look at forbidden love and romance and the end result is an incredibly powerful and tender, even if a touch cold, romance film."", """", ""While its story can often resemble Romeo + Juliet meets 1984, Equals rises above this simple presence to look at love rising above all challenges. However, prior to this, the film establishes a tender and moving romance with impeccable dialogue. Often told through montage by director Drake Doremus, the scenes of Silas and Nia falling in love are terrifically written. As the film visually shows various aspects of the relationship, the dialogue overlaying the visuals highlight the discovery and interest one feels when falling in love. Simple questions such as, \""Have you always had these freckles?\"" or \""What did you look like as a kid?\"" make this relationship really land and feel thoroughly authentic.

Yet, upon discovering that Nia is alive, the film really hits its high note when Silas begs Nia not to give up on him. He still loves her and, in spite of the injections, will try to fight back and show it, while still following through on running away.

Hunt for the Wilderpeople had me in stitches multiple times and, even better, had a terrific message about adoption, acceptance, and unconventional families.

Initially not wanting Ricky in his home, the bond forged between these two is undeniable.

The script from Waititi breathes incredible amounts of life into these two oddballs who have both been resoundingly rejected by society, yet have so much to offer. The writing does a great job developing them as people that are thoroughly relatable, which makes the tale all the more heartbreaking. In particular, scenes in which Ricky is shown running away and being unhappy at his new foster home, are incredibly raw. Waititi does a good job to give them a light feeling, but the implication is truly heartwrenching. Aunt Bella (Rima Te Wiata) certainly helps these scenes, as her love for Ricky is clear, even if she just became his foster mother. Her joy over finally having a child she had wanted for so long is infectious and breathes life into the film even when her role dissipates."", """", ""Though two oddballs being thrown together is a typical trope, Hunt for the Wilderpeople executes it so well, it never feels cliche.

Unable to have their own children, they sought a foster child to fill this void. Though not everyone goes through this, the emotional impact of this reveal and the universal understanding showcase that these characters are real people. Authenticity in film matters and when these characters shown unhappiness or elation, it rubs off on the audience and their emotion is our own."", """", ""Comedically, the film is quite strong.

Given the impeccable cinematography in which Waititi lifts a page out of Peter Jackson's book and inserts shots of New Zealand porn, this one would have been incredible on the big screen.

Daniel Radcliffe is terrific in this film about an idealistic young man who is sent by the FBI to go undercover as a neo-nazi in order to find out their plans for a dirty bomb. Imperium often mirrors reality from its depictions of talking heads all the way to those who are actually willing to sacrifice their livelihood to accomplish their racist goals. At all times, director Daniel Ragussis manages to create tension and keep you on the edge of your seat as Radcliffe's character explores and infiltrates the various groups of neo-nazis. The character development is solid for all, but especially when it comes to our lead, who is really well-developed as well as the concept that the film uses to help us understand the antagonists. Ultimately, they are not too different from ourselves. They have families, friends, jobs, and regular lives. Yet, they turn to hatred through their own feelings of victimhood that they blame on others, which is truly a powerful and unique way of developing empathy for those who often seem so undeserving of it.

It is honestly hard to say what White Girl is truly about, other than the choices made by Leah (Morgan Saylor) coming back to her. Though it is her choice as to who to sleep with, choosing to hang around unsavory characters in all walks of life brings unsavory results to her, leaving her to put together the pieces and struggle to cope with her actions."", ""Starring Morgan Saylor and her nipples as Leah, the film shows her move to inner city Queens with her friend Katie (India Menuez).

What follows is a torrid romance between Blue and Leah, in which Blue plays the role of sympathetic drug dealer. A large well done character, Blue is brought to life by Marc who plays the character in duel fashion. Tough and hard on the outside, Blue melts like butter when around Leah. This is largely highlighted towards the end when he lays on her chest and cries. On the streets, he has a persona - one he opted to showcase to Leah initially - but when he is with her, he is transformed. Though this is a hardly original character, it is hard to deny the phenomenal execution of the character. Not only is he well written by Elizabeth Wood, but brilliantly acted by Marc. Though Saylor is terrific, Marc honestly stole the show."", ""That said, this is Saylor's show and she owns the screen. Magnetic, manic, and energetic, her portrayal of the ill-fated Leah is both tragic and often painful to watch. Though caring and deeply in love with Blue, she still sleeps around and needs to scrounge up cash to pay off a drug dealer and a lawyer. This proves tough and the film is very classic in this plotting. While White Girl is a very good film, its plot is hardly original and this certainly stands as its greatest weakness. Fortunately, there are characters such as Leah. A strong modern day woman, Leah has no shame from her action and owns them. However, her character's strength and power is no revealed until the end. After a truly traumatic experience, Leah is more reserved and withdrawn than usual. This sequence is tremendously brought to life by Saylor as you can see her struggle to keep the pain internalized and not just collapse on the floor in a pool of tears. It is honestly hard to watch with this element bolstered by Saylor's authenticity in the role."", ""All of this said, however, White Girl's plot is incredibly weak. Basically a \""get rich because I need money now\"" type of movie, it is incredibly unrealistic with its portrayal of youth. Sure, there is drug use and lots of sex. However, how many young people today can raise their hands and say they found themselves in the situations that Leah did? I venture to say that not many can. However, as a character study, White Girl is undeniably brilliant. To enjoy White Girl, however, you must reserve judgment on its characters. Rather than pigeonhole a character like Leah and ask, \""What makes her do these things?\"" The film most certainly punishes her for these actions, but they are not the point of the film. She is certainly a tragic figure and not be emulated. I am hardly justifying her actions in the film, but Leah is not a nonredeemable character. Instead, she is merely a child who has lost her way and gotten caught up in living life with new found independence. Though its situations are not authentic, this element most certainly does hit home. As a senior in college, I have seen my fair share of fellow students fail to cope with adjusting to college life and the freedom that comes as part of the deal. Leah fits this bill and, as such, White Girl is a representation, and is an exaggeration, of these types of young-adults."", ""Though I expected to hate White Girl and usually hate films so focused on sex, there is something inherently beautiful about this work from debut director Elizabeth Wood. Haunting, tragic, and an excellent portrayal of lost souls who have strayed from the path, White Girl rides on the shoulders of its characters, particularly Leah and Blue. With terrific performances from Morgan Saylor and Brian Marc, White Girl is a modern day tragedy, but one's enjoyment of the film solely depends on whether or not you are able to see these characters as redeemable figures."" ]";1;3;1;2;0;0
finding-dory;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;Jun 19, 2016;"[ ""While not quite as good as the original, Finding Dory is still yet another wonderful addition to Pixar's filmography. With fantastic voice performances yet again from Ellen Degeneres and Albert Brooks, as well as great turns here from Ed O'Neill, Idris Elba, and Dominic West, Finding Dory is a film packed to the brim with childlike wonder and emotion. A beautifully universal tale of the connection between family members and between you and your friends, Finding Dory is a heartfelt and moving animated tale of Dory trying to find her parents after having a memory of them. While the film can be kind of silly at times, it is obviously an animated film about fish talking, so I cannot really complain too much. That said, it is moving and really funny at times, especially when the sea lions are on the screen. Overall, Finding Dory is a fantastic film from the minds at Pixar and a worthy sequel to the nearly perfect original."" ]";4;6;4;2;0;0
under-the-shadow;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;Oct 26, 2017;"[ ""From Iranian director Babak Anvari comes Under the Shadow, a mesmerizing and terrifying horror film with great social critiques laced with terror. Set during the Iran-Iraq War in the 1980s, Under the Shadow is a film that wears a variety of hats, but somehow manages to have them all fit and work together. As a horror film, Under the Shadow delivers great supernatural thrills with a young girl who, as with all kids in horror movies, might as well be left behind to appease this supernatural thing because not only is she annoying, but she is already friends with the thing. Have to cut your losses at some point. As a critique of the oppression of women in Iran, Under the Shadow is smart with great symbolism and references to the plight of women in the nation as the country ditches the westernization of before and heads into full sharia law. As a war film, Under the Shadows nails the first-hand experience of living through the threats against Tehran by the Iraqis and the palpable fear whipping through the city. All combined, they make Under the Shadow a thought-provoking, thrilling, and USDA-certified piece of nightmare fuel."", ""From the first instant that the audience is introduced to Shideh (Narges Rashidi), we know she is different. Wearing a burqa as she pleads to be allowed to finish her education in medical school, Shideh is a woman who does not allow any oppression to stop her from pursuing her own rules. As the only woman in her apartment complex who drives, a semi-educated doctor who wishes to continue her education, and who works out to Jane Fonda VHS workout tapes on her illegal VHS player, Shideh is certainly liberated. In the country of Iran, she is a major exception amongst the women in her complex, being able to pursue many of the same career and life options as a man. However, her husband Iraj (Bobby Naderi) has mixed feelings, believing she should stay home and not be a doctor (which he says was just her mother's wish). He repeatedly accuses her of being a bad mother to their daughter Dorsa (Avin Manshadi),  which is just part of her oppression by society. After accidentally walking outside without a burqa, she is arrested and told she should feel great shame for revealing herself in such a way, as women should want to wear burqas and fear being seen without one. As the horror of the film unravels, she gets a fake phone call that calls her a disgrace and a whore. Though she may be liberated, Shideh's individuality and freedom is under constant threat from the systemic oppression that is in place in her homeland."", ""Thus, it is no surprise that Under the Shadow smartly has her and Dorsa being attacked by a Djinn, a mythical Arabic being that preys on what people fear. Though Dorsa appears to be the target after her beloved doll goes missing - the djinn allegedly take something somebody loves before taking them - it is actually Shideh who has been chosen by the djinn. Taking the doll to get to Dorsa and with the djinn taking the form of a woman who fills Dorsa's head with thoughts of how Shideh is a bad mother and does not love her, the djinn attempts to woo Dorsa away from her mother and, later, it takes Shideh's science textbook that included a note of admiration from her recently deceased mother (in essence, it meant a lot to her). Thus, it is no surprise that the djinn takes the form of a burqa almost exclusively. The only time it does not is when it appears as a man. Together, the burqa and this man symbolize the way in which society is trying to restrain Shideh and pull her back into line. She must focus on motherhood and being a respectful woman, which means no driving and no school. Her place is in the home and this attacking burqa seeks to cement her - literally, as her feet get stuck in a cement-esque substance that Dorsa has to pull her out of - in her place. As mentioned in the film, djinn present themselves as what one fears the most. Dorsa is not afraid of burqas or women, as she is too young. Thus, she cannot be the one under attack. However, Shideh is afraid of burqas and fears losing her independence if a new government or culture push occurs in Iran that sees her lose what she has gained."", ""Thus, it is no surprise to see the film set during the war as it allows Anvari to lace the film with a great atmosphere. As missiles fly and bombs fall with sirens wailing to warn residents to hide, the tension and fear of the moment is the perfect setting for a being driven by fear to arrive and attack Shideh's family. As people run out of Tehran and Iraj begs his wife to leave the city as well, this palpable fear can be truly felt is brought to the forefront of the film with it being able to operate as a bit of a thriller with this first-hand account of the war. We see the attempts to run away, the fear, and the attempts to live life as if everything were still normal in the city."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0
live-by-night;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;Jan 17, 2017;"[ ""Having read the novel by Dennis Lehane, it became apparent that any adaptation of the novel would have to be long in order to capture the sprawling grandness of the novel. From Boston to jail to Ybor City to Cuba, the book has a lot of players, a lot of angles, lots of action and moving parts, and a lot of subplots. The film adaptation sticks largely to these transitions and mentions many of the subplots without diving into them. This is both to the film's detriment and betterment as it often feels as it lacks the depth necessary to make all of its pieces work, but also feels like it is adding in too much. As many have said, making it shorter or longer would have been for the best. However, the final product - which sits at just over two hours in length - is very, very good. Ultimately a barometer on how much people like Ben Affleck, the critical and audience reaction has said that Affleck sucks at either acting, directing, or writing, or a selection of the trio. Fortunately, for me, I do really enjoy Affleck's work in all three arenas. As such, Live by Night falls right into my wheelhouse and, for the most part, works very well."", ""That said, it is hardly perfect. The beginning section, set in Boston and in jail, is rocky to say the least. For critics who do not enjoy Affleck, this early section makes it easy to write it off as nothing more than a derivative homage to old school gangster and noir flicks. With a femme fatale, underdeveloped morality elements, heists, a cop father, and brushing shoulders with death and gangsters, and doing all of these while smoking a well shot cigarette in a suit with a fedora, the beginning is derivative. It is also messily put together, typically shot, and poorly edited. Scenes smash into one another as Affleck skims through the first 100+ pages of the book to try and get to the good part. He sprinkles little pieces here and there to set the scene and tries to rush through it all. Likely, editing this portion was a real pain as it is the slowest part of the film and is entirely necessary. As such, it flies by and feels wholly inadequate."", ""For this who decide to stick around, however, Affleck delivers a tremendous gangster flick once we hit Ybor City. Charged with running the rum operation in Tampa of gangster Maso Pescatore (Remo Girone), Joe Coughlin (Affleck) is a nice guy. He can kill, but cannot live with the guilt. While the beginning is derivative and typical of gangster flicks, this section is hardly typical. Cruel gangster with a conscience has been done before, but not quite like this. Instead, he is an uncruel gangster who operates more as a remorseful businessman. His line of business demands violence, but unless the person makes an overt case for deserving a bullet to the head, he is hardly a gunman. Instead, he runs a tremendous operation and lives out the American dream with his best friend Dino Bartolo (Chris Messina) at his side. Taking on the KKK and the gang of Albert White (Robert Gleinster) at every turn, Joe is able to defeat all comers. He corners the market in Ybor City and, as the book explains more and the movie hints at, the entirety of the South stretching to New Orleans. Raking in cash, he also meets a Cuban freedom fighter who becomes his wife, Graciela Suarez (Zoe Saldana). Life is good as he plans on opening a casino to preempt the legalization of alcohol. Until he meets Loretta Figgis (Elle Fanning)."", ""The daughter of Chief Sheriff Irving Figgis (Chris Cooper), Loretta is gorgeous. She is off to Hollywood, but trips along the way and falls into heroin and the sex trade. Joe brings her back to Ybor City as his end of a bargain with Irving in exchange for a KKK member's head. Loretta returns and becomes a preacher who commands a large congregation and builds up serious political sway. She also happens to be anti-gambling, as she views it as a vice and a sin against God. Though directed to kill her, Joe cannot. She kills the casino deal and ends Joe's run as the Mayor of Ybor. Why could he not kill her? Well, to explain that, it really dives into what makes Live by Night so good."", ""Early in the film, Joe's father Thomas Coughlin (Brendan Gleeson) warns his bandit of a son that we reap what we sow in life. Joe, a good man, knows this. He knows that his gangster lifestyle will come back to haunt him because of the violence he must commit to remain relevant. He kills people via booze, pimps out girls, and sells drugs. He is not a good man and this bothers him. As Albert White explains to Joe early in the film, Joe is looking for somebody to make him pay for his sins. Joe is remorseful and regrets his sins, which is why he cannot kill Loretta. He envies and admires her. She went to hell and back. She preaches and lives up to the word of God. She sinned and escaped retribution for her sins. She outran the rebuking (her father spanking her does not count). This is really underscored in the final shot of the film."" ]";1;2;1;1;0;0
la-la-land;10;Spangle;/user/Spangle;Dec 16, 2016;"[ ""Postmodernism is a film theory that suggests that there is nothing original anymore. If it could be made, it has been made and we are doomed to simply remake a once original idea in perpetuity. Postmodernism also includes ideas regarding nostalgia and hyperreality, positing that cities such as Los Angeles may physically be real, but are in fact, dream worlds that are not actually there. In Damien Chazelle's latest work and, dare I say already, his magnum opus, La La Land, this theory takes center stage. Presenting a world of nostalgia of past love, of old Hollywood, and of jazz, La La Land takes place in the hyperreality of Los Angeles. Though undeniably a celebration of the past and showcasing Chazelle's admiration for old school filmmaking, La La Land is also a critique of nostalgia."", ""To critique and subvert rules, however, you must understand them. You must embrace them and then tear them apart at the seams so that may no longer be put together. In the first half of the film, Chazelle does exactly this. With large, kinetic, and detailed choreography and musical scenes, the opening sequence is straight out of 1940s/1950s Hollywood with the golden age of MGM. On the wall of Mia Dolan's (Emma Stone) bedroom is a poster of Ingrid Bergman. Another poster in the common area of her apartment has a movie poster featuring John Lancaster and Ava Gardner. Mia works in the Warner Bros. lot across the street from where Casablanca was shot. She and Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) have a first date watching Rebel Without a Cause at an old school moviehouse that uses film. The scene of Mia and her roommates strutting down the road is colorful, bombastic, and embraces the vibrancy of old school musicals. La La Land, right down to the details, is about old Hollywood. Similarly, it is about old school Jazz. Sebastian, a piano player, loves jazz and its history. He dreams of opening a jazz club honoring Charlie Parker in its title and replacing the bastardization of the music he loves with its pure past. With bright spotlights, a deep blue hue to the scene, and gorgeous suits, Sebastian's every look and action embraces the history of jazz. The film lush, jazzy score in these moments and its nostalgic song \""City of Stars\"" embrace this world. Yet, both old Hollywood and old school jazz are merely a mirage now. \""City of Stars\"" - a beautifully written and composed piece of music - is dreamy in its melody. It glides by and paints a gorgeous picture of a world that does not exist. This applies to the elements that celebrated here by Chazelle. They are in the past, though they can still be loved, they are not to be emulated. In creating this world initially though, Chazelle strictly follows postmodernism. He uses Los Angeles' hyperreality to create dream sequences that play out in real life. From Mia and Sebastian tap dancing with a view of the city beneath them or them floating up into the stars in an observatory, Chazelle highlights the city's dream-like state of being. During the entirety of the film, the city has a blue filter over it and the end result is that it feels distant and otherworldly. It never feels attainable and - in the minds of Mia, Sebastian, and the audience - the city exists solely in our dreams. And boy do our couple ever dream. Both have huge dreams and, initially, they encourage one another to follow these dreams. Mia follows her acting dream by writing her own one-woman play. Sebastian joins a band in order to raise funds. However, their obsession with the past tears them down. Mia fails. Her play is a failure and no one attends. Her only hope is a TV show that mixes Dangerous Minds with The OC and bears no resemblance to the old Hollywood style of filmmaking she so adores. Sebastian plays music in a band with a guy he hates as the lead singer and music that betrays the soul of the jazz music he loves. Both have sold out and have careened off course. Why? Because of the nostalgia. They became so infatuated with their love of the past, they tried to live it and become a part of the past. Unfortunately, time travel does not yet exist and this is impossible. Times change and things move forward. If you move to the past, you will be left behind in favor of the future. Here, nostalgia can be a destructive force and serves only to distract one from moving forward and attacking life. For Mia and Sebastian, their love of the past distracted them from their goals and, instead of working towards those goals, their reverse focus led to them walking backwards away from their goals. Their relationship even falls into this nostalgia, as evidenced by the very end. Chazelle breaks up the film into seasons, beginning with winter. Here, Mia and Sebastian are incredibly cold to one another and barely know each other. By spring, things heat up and begin to simmer. In summer, their love is brimming with happiness and joy."" ]";4;7;4;3;2;0
lion;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;Feb  7, 2017;"[ ""Going into watching Lion, I expected a cliched feel good film. I expected it to be overly manipulative and, while a solid film, nothing particularly special. My expectations were misguided, however. A powerful, spiritual, and lyrical journey to find one's own identity, Lion is a film that snuck up on me, but left me in absolute ruins. The power of this film is not to be understated as Lion is a film that never ceases to be powerful and emotionally impactful. It discards the cliches, develops characters, and is a film whose emotional power is well earned and never manipulative. For a feature-length debut for director Garth Davis, Lion is a film with incredible strength, gravitas, and a film that is a full-fledged drama that shows the potential of feel-good cinema."", ""Refusing to be bottled into cliches, Lion is a film that finds power from the very beginning. Set in India, young Saroo (Sunny Pawar) is lost on a train and winds up 1,600 KM away from home. Home, a very small place in rural India, is the polar opposite in terms of language and build than Calcutta, which is where he winds up. Dodging child traffickers and abuse left and right, this sequence not only highlights Saroo's journey, but the journey of other children. As the epilogue describes, 80,000 Indian children go missing each year. This journey to Calcutta experienced by Saroo highlights the abominable conditions of homeless children in India. Heartbreakingly enough, there are a large number of them he encounters who are rounded up by nefarious characters. Even in the orphanage, the treatment is horrendous. However, Saroo's life is changed when he is adopted by John (David Menham) and Sue (Nicole Kidman). An Australian couple, Sue had a vision that she would adopt an Indian child and, sure enough, she turned her vision into a reality with Saroo. In his portrayal of Saroo, Sunny Pawar is brilliant. Obviously, he is adorable. But, he never seems to be acting. This feels like his life and one that he is familiar with, even subconsciously. Pawar cannot be older than five or so, but he is phenomenal in this film and gives a natural performance for a film that demands one. His confusion and authenticity lends the film considerable gravity, but so does the introduction of his adoptive brother Mantosh. Adopted by John and Sue a year after Saroo, Mantosh is broken. Whatever happened to him and whatever he saw has left him shattered internally, constantly hitting himself when he is upset. Though this is a film about Saroo finding his birth parents, weight is given to Mantosh's role in the film. Highlighting just how lucky Saroo was to escape his circumstances unscathed, Mantosh is a sobering adult. He stays away from his parents and Saroo because he knows how bad he is, which is heartbreaking. Divian Ladwa is brilliant in this relatively small role and makes the most of this broken man. The film, after initially showing Saroo getting used to life in Australia, jumps ahead to Saroo as an adult (Dev Patel). Dating Lucy (Rooney Mara), the duo \""meet cute\"", but that is not hard when Rooney Mara is in the film. Together, Patel and Mara have insatiable chemistry and the two work terrifically well together. Rising above the classic cliche of leaving Lucy as just Saroo's girlfriend with no grit of her own, Lion ensures that it is clear Lucy has a life of her own. She has her own emotions, passions, and interests. Suddenly, however, these diverge when Saroo becomes obsessed with finding his birth parents. Though perhaps going on for too long, Saroo's descent into anger, resentment, and panic as he searches fervently on Google Earth for any clue as to where his family could be. He resents himself for not finding them sooner and can only imagine the pain and anguish felt by his mother. The film is incredibly somber in these moments, punctuated by the score by Hauschka and Dustin O'Halloran. Nominated for Best Original Score, the score may be a bit too noticeable at times, but it is brilliantly orchestrated in spite of that concern."", ""However, the moment we are all waiting for is Saroo finding his birth mother. The moment is chilling. It is one of the most powerful scenes put in a film all year. Yes, it is manipulative. Yes, it is sentimental. But dammit, I almost cried. I had to fight back the tears to be able to still watch. The look on his mother's face, the embrace, her hand running through his hair and on his face, the little peck on the forehead Saroo gives her, UGH. I was in ruins. There is no way to deny this film's power in this moment. It may be manipulative and something out of Extreme Makeover: Home Edition after Ty Pennington shouts, \""Move. That. Bus!\"", but man is it ever effective. It is a sequence that has anticipation, power, and one where director Garth Davis steps back and allows us to feel the full power of the moment. Yet, he is not done making my eyes wage war on the tears."" ]";1;1;1;0;0;0
manchester-by-the-sea;8;Spangle;/user/Spangle;Dec 21, 2016;"[ ""Utterly devastating. Bleak and unrelenting, Manchester by the Sea is akin to being bludgeoned repeatedly by an axe aimed straight at your heart. Once in a while, a film will come along and leave me in a ball of tears. Films can only accomplish this, however, by putting the audience right alongside the characters and making us feel their pain and agony. Their pain becomes our own and it makes the experience feeling entirely personal. Manchester by the Sea is this kind of film. By the end, Lee Chandler's (Casey Affleck) depression became my own and, as a result, the film left me feeling heavy. Elegantly written, score, and directed, Manchester by the Sea is an operatic and thoroughly depressing film. If you are in a tough spot right now, either this film will be oddly therapeutic or just leave you wallowing in tears."", ""Anchored by an impeccable lead performance by Casey Affleck, Manchester by the Sea tells the story of Lee Chandler returning home to Manchester to care for his nephew, Patrick (Lucas Hedges). Thrown into guardianship following the death of his brother, Joe (Kyle Chandler), Lee is divorced from his wife Randi (Michelle Williams). Returning home brings up various bad memories for Lee, which makes the journey especially difficult. Suffering from a deep depression before and during his return as a result of these memories, Manchester by the Sea is an examination of the grieving process and how we cope with tragedy. For Lee, he has turned into an emotionally remote man who can hardly converse with anybody else. As he blames himself for his issues, his depression compounds upon itself and leaves him incredibly numb. For Patrick, losing his father only has an impact in quiet moments. Small elements - such as the fact that his father needs to be frozen until Spring when the ground is soft enough to bury him - bother him deeply. Otherwise, he continues on with his life and finds things to keep himself busy. For Randi, she is still deeply shaken by her own actions, rather than what actually happened and how she treated Lee as a result. Both Hedges and Williams are tremendous as well. Hedges truly shines when Patrick has a panic attack. Here, your heart truly breaks and Hedges' raw emotion and authenticity make the scene land even harder. For Williams, she absolutely deserves another Academy Award nomination. She gets very little to chew on, but when given the opportunity in a conversation with Lee, my God. Powerful barely scratches the surface of this scene. Williams is a revelation in this scene and, in one moment, steals the entire film. As a whole though, the acting in Manchester by the Sea is a step above the acting of any other film this year."", ""In examining grief, Manchester by the Sea takes the varied approaches as described above. Lee cannot get over his grief to the point that he can hardly be in Manchester. Patrick wants to continue to live his life. Randi is grieving the dissolution of her marriage because it did not need to happen. Though hardly profound, the film exemplifies that we all \""grieve in our own way\"". Yet, the masterful element in this portrayal is its division between the sexes. When Lee is down, Joe steps up and cares for him. He shows emotion, yes, but he is in control. His emotion is bottled up and he is solely focused on helping his brother through this ordeal. For Lee, when Joe dies and after his own issues, he bottles it up. His only expression of his internal anger and pain is when he gets into bar fights. Part him needing to find out if he can still feel anything and part venting, these bar fights exemplify the way in which men often internalize their pain. Similarly, Patrick is headed down the same path with few scenes where he lets loose. Otherwise, as mentioned above, he simply goes along with his life of hockey, baseball, band, and his two girlfriends. Things do not alter much for him and, outwardly, he is laughing and as charismatic as he was before. His pain only comes in private when things remind him of his pain. Instead, he seeks distractions and constant chaos (depicted by Lee driving him all over God's green earth without end) in order to cope. Randi, however, has hardly internalized her pain. Instead, she vented at Lee in the past and, now, cried openly before him to express her agony of what went on between the two of them. Not to be too stereotypical, but women are certainly better at expressing their emotions and the film underscores this. When Lee and Patrick are together, there is a mutual understanding that they are both in pain, but neither divulge or open up as to how they are feeling. When Lee is with Randi, you can see how uncomfortable he is with this display of emotion, even if it is what he needed to hear."" ]";0;1;0;1;0;0

No matter how smart and funny it is, the cringey actions of Ingrid Thorburn (Aubrey Plaza) keep the film as being one that is often best watched through the gaps between one's fingers. Spiraling out of control as she stalks and befriends social media influencer Taylor Sloane (Elizabeth Olsen), strikes up a romance with landlord Dan Pinto (O'Shea Jackson Jr.), and moves to Los Angeles, Ingrid is a woman with a few screws loose in her head. A tragic figure, she serves as the gateway for director Matt Spicer to critique modern culture, celebrity worship, and reveal the damage both have done to those who partake or follow these vapid and fake human beings that proliferate social media. Equal parts funny, dark, and sad, Ingrid Goes West is an excellent feature debut for Spicer."", ""From the very get go, we are introduced to the world of Ingrid. Using Instagram extensively and being hurt by a \""friend\"" that did not invite her to her wedding, Ingrid resorts to stalking the woman's instagram, crying over the wedding photos, and then showing up to pepper spray the beaming bride. Locked up in a mental hospital, healing, and soon released, Ingrid decides to get a new start in Los Angeles after reading a magazine ominously calls Taylor Sloane \""your next girl crush\"". A classic social media influencer with sponsored posts, \""deep\"" quotes with stupid photos, and living in a constant state of vacation, Taylor is the perfect target for Ingrid. Working her way in Taylor's life by stealing her dog and then returning it the next day, Ingrid befriends Taylor and her husband Ezra (Wyatt Russell) effortlessly and quickly catapults to minor stardom after she is included in an Instagram post by Taylor. Meanwhile, she uses her inheritance from her mother's death to rent an apartment from Dan and abuses his trust by both taking his car all day, missing a planed appointment with him that she agreed to in order to borrow his car, and by wrecking that very same car. What ensues is an often chilling portrait of modern society and the damaging effects social media has had."", ""Chief amongst these critiques is Spicer's demonstration of how life is now lived through phones and social media. Part of it is certainly being obsessed with news and what is happening, but much of it is in the desperate search for affirmation. By liking posts on Instagram and commenting constantly, Ingrid hopes to create new friends and be as popular as the girls she sees on the site. In a life of solitude after her mother's death, this world of social media is her only opportunity for human interaction and she makes the very most of this chance. Yet, she is hardly the only one. Taylor lives her life in a similar fashion, yet is never called deranged for the same behavior. She lives behind a screen, posts constantly to remain popular, and forgets to actually live life in the process. Even worse, her world vision is so warped by social media that she convinces Ezra to quit his job to make paintings where he just takes somebody else's work, tosses a social media buzzword like \""#SQUADGOALS\"" on it, and then sell it for over $1,000. This constant and desperate search for affirmation in the eyes of followers, shows the dangerous impact social media has had on our world. Emotion, feeling, experience, and life, have become disposable. In their place, false compliments and shallow popularity have taken their place with people valuing themselves solely based upon how many followers they have and how many likes they get. Prior to her discovering that Ingrid is a psycho, Taylor is great friends with her. However, once Harley (Pom Klementieff) - a social influencer with 1 million followers - arrives in town, Taylor forgets all about Ingrid. Even her husband feels slighted by her new lifestyle, as she was once a normal girl with no friends in Los Angeles, but would now do anything for followers. By sacrificing herself and her own personality in the name of becoming famous on Instagram, Taylor has lost herself in this world and, for many, the same exact thing occurs. Social media has become people's reality with a phone not just being a device to call or text occasionally, but rather a life support machine that serves as a person's only connection to the outside world. In Ingrid Goes West, we see Taylor and Ingrid do drugs, blow their money, and practically sell their soul, to gain any semblance of popularity. For them, nothing is too steep a price for a like on Instagram."" ]";0;2;0;2;0;0

Even more, John Boyega, Daisy Ridley, Oscar Isaac, Domhnall Gleeson, and Adam Driver, are fantastic actors and do a great job here. I cannot wait to see where the series goes from here. JJ Abrams does a great job blending new and old here by giving diehards the nostalgia they crave and giving the new generation the new adventures they crave. The writing was strong and the special effects were out of this world. The score was great, but should not win the Oscar for Best ORIGINAL Score due to just being a copy-paste of previous Star Wars scores with some new tracks alongside the ones of old. My main problem with Episode IV and then the prequels were the whiny characters and thankfully that is not the case here. At no point are they whiny and this really elevates the film. I think much of the criticism in regards to characterization and story are kind of stupid admittedly because this is the first of a trilogy.

There are some nitpickings here and there, some doubtful physical effect or weird character motivation, but it's still eons ahead of almost any sci-fi movie by scientific and logical cohesion. Most of the science-related elements are moderately explained, short enough not to break the suspense. It has it's tense and relaxed moments, it's bit of romance and humor, all mixed together in chemically precise proportions, giving an epic overall experience.

After much anticipation, I finally got to see the follow up to director Damien Chazelle's breakout hit \""Whiplash\"". This movie blew me away. For someone who is not into musical's, this one locked me in from start to finish. Every song in the movie is fantastic and the musical set pieces truly compliment the songs in such stylish fashion. This is very much in the vein of 1940s and 1950s musicals while still being its own thing. The movie is also a love story between Mia and Sebastian played by Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling. This is not only their third collaboration together, but easily their best. Both Stone and Gosling give the performances of their careers. They bring out a lot of great comedy and make you believe that anything is possible. I believe they both should get best acting oscar nominations. The movie showcases the struggles of following your dreams with the complications of being in a relationship. I love how the title has a double meaning. Los Angeles (where the movie takes place) is also known as La La Land. The place where dreams are made. However, the movie shows how difficult and frustrating that idea can be and how the real world is nothing like the movies tend to make it out to be. Which leads to why the movie ended in such a heartbreaking but touching way. It takes hard work to pursue your dreams, but not everything turns out the way you want it in the end. There are some sacrifices to be made in life and the ending really hit me hard with that message. This is by far the best movie of 2016! It is a beautifully directed musical that presents interesting ideas while paying homage to old classics. I give \""La La Land\"" an A+!"" ]";3;4;3;1;1;0
hacksaw-ridge;9;Movie1997;/user/Movie1997;Dec 13, 2016;"[ ""Wow. Talk about a fascinating war movie. This is truly the most visceral and engaging war movie since \""Saving Private Ryan\"" (1998). First off, I have to commend Mel Gibson for his beautiful direction. Say what you want about the man, but he knows how to engage an audience through gripping visuals and interesting characters. Which leads me to the performances. I was surprised to see great performances from the entire cast. Initially, I was anxious to see Teresa Palmer and Vince Vaughn in this movie, but they both surprisingly fit into the movie almost seamlessly. A particular standout is Hugo Weaving. His performance was a bit too real for me and reminded me of a man that I know that was very similar to Weaving's character. Nevertheless, I found him to be one of the best characters in this movie. But the big standout is Andrew Garfield as Desmond Doss. Garfield brings a child-like personality into the role. We see Doss learn how violence can really take a toll on one's inner self which is what makes him the man he becomes as the film plays out. It also tests his own morals and how despite the trials tribulations faced that stand in his way, he still stays true to what he believes. Easily one of the most fascinating characters portrayed this year thanks in large part to Garfield's performance. Finally, let's talk about the war sequences in the film. In a nutshell, they are powerful. Like I mentioned, it the most visceral war film since \""Saving Private Ryan\"" (1998). The war sequences are very hard to watch and can leave you feeling sick. However, it is all portrayed beautifully. Even more fascinating are the moments in which we follow Doss through the war and see how his morals come into play. Both halves of the movie are completely different, but they both help structure our main character and show how he deals with both basic training and the war itself. In regards to flaws, only a couple of moments at the beginning of the film felt very conventionally. However, as the film plays on, it continuously becomes more of an experience as opposed to watching a made for TV movie. Overall, this is a fascinating war drama with a great story and a terrific leading character. I give \""Hacksaw Ridge\"" an A! Definitely check this one out."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

Yes, the movie is driven with dialogue to tell its story and it may turn people off, but if you're into engaging dialogue then this is the movie for you. I love how the movie explores the nature of man and how we often judge people as a society. It never flinched away from this subject matter but it also introduced real human connection from two opposite parties. While there are not many scenes like it but when its just a scene Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance, you feel this bond start to form amongst the two. In many ways, they form an unlikely friendship. I love how Spielberg transports us to this Cold War Era. You can feel his stamp through every shot and frame and even through the movie's narrative structure. And Thomas Newman is a great replacement for John Williams as a composer. For the type of music he's known for it really suites the movie well and fits in seamlessly.

I figured some of the lines would be quorky and lame, but it was surprisingly well written. And finally, the action. For an old classic like this, the action is very intense, fun and enjoyable. This is one of those movies that I wished I had already known. This is definitely one of the biggest movies ever made. Just ask an folk if they've seen Raiders of the Lost Ark.

Christopher Nolan is usually known for such big and complex stories like \""Inception\"" \""The Prestige\"" and \""Memento\"". He is currently the most ambitious director working today. Ambition can lie between being a great pro towards a film like this, or be a big con! The first time I saw it, it felt that the film was too ambitious in which it took over from the overall experience/pure enjoyment of the film. There was just too much to take in. But that's why the film is so watchable in my opinion. Christopher Nolan keeps you wanting more with a film like this. That's why the second time was a charm for me. I delved deeper into the film unlike the first and truly got an overall enjoyment out it. I love the space mission aspect of the film. I love the story behind this. I love the characters, especially Matthew McConaughay (Cooper). I love Zimmer's score. And I truly love Nolan's ambition! However Some characters felt completely under-used, like Cooper's son played by Casey Affleck. I love how they set up this character throughout the film, but I wish they could have used him more as a big character throughout the entire film. They just gloss over an interesting story element in which I think could have helped build the film especially for the theme of the movie. Also, Wes Bentley's character felt completely wasted and somewhat unneeded. Alongside that, the first 40 minutes of the film felt a little too slow to me. But once it gets into its space exploration, the film soars all the way up to its last 10 minutes (which I enjoyed more than most but still felt something missing).

We saw a ton of this in Inception, where almost every shot in the final dream sequence was of someone explaining the rules of Nolan's universe. Interstellar has Dr. Brand explaining the multi-dimensional science of love for too long, Dr. Mann ruminating on the nature of humanity, and Cooper reviewing the rules of relativity over and over.

It recreates all that was so brilliant about the first but fine-tunes it in a manner so that it happens on a scale much larger and much more ambitious, with a wide scope traversing decades and continents that intersects the past with the present in its ferocious exploration on how organised crime shapes those who operate at its highest levels. Returning cast members up their game, especially John Cazale, Diane Keaton and Talia Shire, and Coppola replenishes the ranks with a stellar supporting cast that includes memorable turns from Robert De Niro and Michael V.

But no-one can detract from Al Pacino, who tops the brilliance of his first outing as Michael Corleone with a mesmerising, electric tour de force of Macbethian portents that gives this film its heart and its gut: both are as crucial to the film's impact as the other. Where Part I was more cerebral and restrained in its meditation on matters of morality, Part II opens the floodgates to unleash a blistering and merciless cascade of betrayal, savagery, bitterness, passion, vengeance and irreconcilable guilt and greed as corrosive as the other, eventually leaving us with something that is tragic, elegiac and searingly true.

I also consider it one of the most underrated films of the 2000s. The story of a rebellious and privileged misfit from an upper-class family that is as dysfunctional as it is wealthy, it plays somewhat like a reinterpretation of \""The Catcher in the Rye\"". That is a comparison that has been made by several others, but it's an apt comparison nonetheless; director/writer Burr Steers understands Igby as well as J.D. Salinger understood Holden Caulfield. And as well as Salinger realised Holden on the page, the ideally-cast Kieran Culkin realises Igby just as well on-screen. Igby is a kid who's grown up the straight man in a perniciously dysfunctional family that expects him to be perfect when they are anything but. He resents this, quite understandably, and this resentment manifests in a rebellious streak Culkin communicates with impeccably-timed and lacerating sarcasm. And the resentment has fostered a palpable sense of loneliness, which is painfully evident at several points throughout the film and also conveyed beautifully by Culkin. Igby's monologue when a one-shot lover rejects him in favour of his brother is the best showcase for this. This is not a one-note portrayal. Culkin has a lot of material to handle, requiring a range of emotions, and he pulls it off seamlessly. That he towers above a cast of acting heavyweights such as Susan Sarandon, Jeff Goldblum, and Bill Pullman is testament to what an astonishing achievement his performance in this film is.

The film shows how war is, what it does to people, and the reality of it. How it greatly affects them to the point where they are a completely different person. It also showed how there were bad and good people in the war on both sides. I would have given this movie a solid 10 if it weren't for two problems. The first is a sequence in the middle of the film that ran on way too long and took you out of the movie. It could have been shortened to 10 minutes or even taken out entirely. It doesn't add much to the plot. The second is the final battle..The Germans all the sudden have storm trooper like aim. These are really the only problems I had with the movie. As for American propaganda, there is definitely still some but not that much. Way less than I was expecting. One thing I have to talk about is the overall sound.

While I do understand it, I can't help but think \""wait, what?\"" And not in a bad way. Interstellar makes you think beyond the boundaries of what you may have been taught at school about physics, philosophy and ethics. I can't stand physics nor do I try to understand it in my everyday life, but this movie makes you look hard at the physical reality and complexity of what is out there, while still reminding you of the depth within ourselves. Yes - at times - the script is questionable and the score can be awkward, but McConaughey, Chastain and Hathaway are so utterly convincing and brutal, and the direction of Nolan as well as the cinematography is so awe-inspiring and bold, this does not matter. It is hard to truly review this film without ruining the flow of surprises, but Interstellar is more than your average sci-fi movie; Interstellar is complex and enthralling, scientific and philosophical, emotional and tense.

Much like Inception it's a movie that gets you thinking, regardless of whether the premise is totally possible or not.

Some areas of the plot seemed a bit weak, there were parts in which I didn't understand how something had actually happened and where things were actually going. The entire thing seemed like a huge space soap-opera with McConaughey's perpetual bond with his Earth-bound daughter being the glue that held the entire movie together. The script seemed a tad bit weak in areas with some lines seemingly written up by a 10-year-old. The movie seemed to hold the viewers hand in some areas as it practically attempted to spell out the most complicated areas so that the viewer could understand and keep up.

Rosamund Pike is even slightly better than Affleck's character. Kim Dickens character was really amusing as the detective. Carrie Coon's character \""Margo\""  was had a good comedic presence to the screen, but at times the stuff she says sometimes can be at the wrong time so that's what  i guess. I am not sure if this film is gonna impact Perry's career, but it'll get the guy a better role. Neil Patrick Harris' character  is awkward and lovely at times. But the ending is stupid!

Interstellar is quite simply a stunning spectacle, but also achieves an unprecedented amount of characterization for each individual character whilst also using them as a platform to scrutinize humanity's greatest flaws, but also its greatest strengths, something which lends this epic a broad emotional range as well as amazing shots of the cold, bleak and beautiful desolation of space and other worlds.  These characters would have been nothing though without the great acting carried out by everyone, especially McConaughey, who has somehow gone from generic 2D 'pretty boy' rom-coms to bleak, apocalyptic sci epics with apparent ease, he manages to root the existential chaos of the barren future with very human roots, and lends a defiant optimism in a film which does bleak and despondent very well indeed."", """", ""The theme of survival is done exceptionally well, and whereas Inception was an ambitious mess which seemed to trumpet its importance without ever truly justifying it, the setting of unpredictable and chaotic space lends itself much more naturally to the confusion and awe which Nolan strives towards.

interstellar;9;jfarooq;/user/jfarooq;Nov 10, 2014;"[ ""Nolan does it again man and am even more a Nolan fan now. It's another mind-bender from him, where he forces audience to think and reason. I like the fact that while mostly based on proved scientific theories the movie later suddenly falls into the philosophical/mind-bender genre like Nolan's many other movies. The movie feels a little slow in the beginning but it slowly builds up and ends on a great note. The father- daughter relationship works most of the times, and some of those times it is very emotional. People say his movies lack heart and emotions. He proved that wrong with this one. Those scenes with Matt Damon on that planet are very thrilling though also a little confusing because of Matt's character's ambiguous intentions. And that scene where his character gets part of the Endurance destroyed and Cooper attaches to the destroyed part is extremely well done. Hans Zimmer's score over all and particularly in that scene deserves high accolades. He succeeded to bring a totally new sound to the move, even though there were places where it reminded me of the extraordinary and his best in my opinion score of Inception. Loved that scene with those tall waves too. Loved the depiction of worm and black holes, especially that of black hole is so beautiful and mysterious. I wish they had shown more of it (see my comments next). The plot is quite complex. There is lot of science involved. And because of our limited understanding of that level of science at points it seems there are plot holes while there are actually not that many. And especially after he dropped into the black hole it all suddenly becomes so very confusing and at the same time so very away of the scientific theme of the movie before that. It falls in that metaphorical/philosophical genre. It's here where it has a lot common with Inception. Like Inception the movie had me thinking after it was finished, and require multiple viewing to grasp it entirely, which again is a triumph for Nolan, I believe. Acting is top-notch. Matthew was great overall, he nailed the emotionally scenes particularly. I have started to like the guy now. Besides him I think Mackenzie Foy also did a splendid job."", """", ""I do have some problems with it though, and that's why the missing one star in my rating. (1) It's barely a space movie. It couldn't never make me feel like I was in the space like Gravity did. I was expecting more scenes in the space with wide views of earth, stars and other planets. More scenes on heights. More scenes flying across other planets etc. I was expecting much more scenes with black hole and worm holes. They were on screen barely for few minutes. I wonder the money and effort they spent on building those things and how beautiful they looked especially the black hole but they didn't bother to show it more than a few minutes. And by the way what's about that total silence (zero OST/music) in space scenes? (2) The final scene where Cooper meets Murph could have been more emotional. I wonder a little that getting back to her was his mission all the time but there wasn't even a single tear in his eyes in that scene. I would have loved to see a crying Cooper like in one of those earlier scenes when he sees Murph's message on screen. (3) The very last scene where Cooper goes for Brand was totally unnecessary in my opinion. It was like that scene in TDKR where Batman kisses Catwoman/Selina Kyle before flying the bomb out of Gotham. Cheesy, unclassy and very un-Nolan. The whole movie was about father-daughter love then where did they get this guy-girl love in that. Looked quit a commercial move by Nolan."", """", ""Anyway, overall another classic from Nolan, another triumph, another movie which reminds us why we love movies and why they are so powerful. Marvelous work Nolan, keep it up."" ]";3;5;3;2;0;0

I won't spoil anything, but at certain points of the movie concerning relativity, my tears threatened to spill. Interstellar also boasts some phenomenal special effects that I dare say rivals 2013's Gravity in terms of scope. The movie is also paced excellently, never dabbling too long in each entertaining section. Finally the music by Hans Zimmer is incredible.

It’s savage and kinda shocking but also makes you laugh at how unexpected it is! I think this adds a more serious tone over the film which is why it is a PG but it is still definitely a kids film.

However, i believe the user score is not as high as people have become accustomed to and expectant of a overused horror trope nowadays: the jump scare. This film has no jumpscares what so ever and this is why some people may not like it as much as they expect to s**t themselves for a second and then be \""all is okay now\"". The thing that makes the Babadook so scary is that it relies on psychological horror and it's engaging and complex storyline that can actually be dissected and analysed instead of most horror films typical \""this person is possessed, save them\"" or \""there is a monster coming to kill us, we must run\"" or \""there's ghosts haunting us\"". This films psychological horror really is a breath of fresh air as it's eerie, dark and ambiguous tone and atmosphere really send shivers done your spine. This never makes you jump really, but more makes you feel uncomfortable and unsettled. The performances are spot on by Essie Davis and Noah Wiseman plays his role excellently: he seems annoying and ungrateful and then turns sympathetic and understandable. 10/10 for creating an original horror that good es back to it's roots; it wants to chill you for days instead of make you jump for a few seconds. One of the classics of horror now. 10/10. Bravo to Jennifer Kent for creating this masterpiece."" ]";1;3;1;2;1;0

This film brought out what looked like the Max he had always wanted to make. The film had mesmerizing actions sequences partially due to the lack of shaky cam one million shot action takes and keeping you on the action at all times and also due in part to the beautiful cinematography the film carried. The setting is also a lovely vibrant colour that makes each scene look eye watering."", ""Now the characters. Max was the mentally tormented Max we'd really wanted to see over all these films (his previous incarnations never really being mad but just angry) and Tom Hardy brought a nice presence on screen. His dialogue was short and to the point at most times as of his one instinct: survive. His accent was indistinguishable and voice coarse due to obviously not having much social interaction since the world fell. These were nice subtle touches."", ""Now Charlize Theron is probably one of the greatest heroines since Ripley in Aliens, and brought a grit and determination to the film. Her and Hardy worked off of each other well with contrasting and harmonizing qualities."", ""Also, Miller has created some extra subtle but brilliant scene in this film outside of all the action, for instance one scene when Max is about to shotgun someone's hand off to detach his chains, with this scene building up quickly, obviously and brilliantly. Also, in this scene (and many others) there are call backs to the previous Mad Max films that don't feel forced into this film for nostalgia but actually work within this film by themselves as well."", ""However, to have anything to criticize about this film would possibly be the dialogue. It's pretty plainly written and could be done by most 18 year old film students. Additionally to that, the kind of romance that blooms between Nux and the bride seems a bit blunt and stupid really, not really advancing the story and making a character you wish had good intentions but was still bat **** insane into a heroic whelping softy. And finally, the stories way of concluding itself (backtracking of sorts) seemed pretty ridiculous but it still worked well, and for the majority of these criticisms to be honest don't really matter too much when you watch this film as an action film, and that's what you should go see it as. All these people saying it was a bad film due to such and such aren't looking at this film as an action film, which IS what it is."", ""Overall, with beautiful visual eye candy, ecstatically amazing action sequences, solid performances and a good bit of humour here and there Mad Max has ended up being an action film to remember and the pinnacle of the franchise (so far).

The cast of young men includes Ezra Miller, Moises Arias, Nicholas Braun, Logan Miller, Tye Sheridan and Thomas Mann. All of which deliver some of the best performances of their young careers. The highlight of the whole cast however was Michael Angarano, who becomes the most demanding and abusive guard of them all and becoming an easy character to hate. It is thrilling to watch the transformation of the characters over the course of the experiment where the identity is taken away from the prisoners through a number of methods and the guards go through effort to hide their true identity by hiding behind sunglasses and baton."", """", ""Billy Crudup is great in this film as well.

the-gift-2015;9;ydnar4;/user/ydnar4;Aug  7, 2015;"[ ""I decided to see The Gift rather than the Fantastic Four and I was pleasantly surprised with how great this movie was. Joel Edgerton was heavily involved in this project. He wrote, produced and directed this film as well as playing a key role in the movie, but I never felt that Edgerton was tooting his own horn, the whole film felt very natural. This guy certainly is talented in more ways than one and I have to say that The Gift is one of the best thrillers that I have seen in recent years. There are three really good performances in this film. Jason Bateman shows some range in his acting ability and this is definitely my favorite role from him. Bateman is known for playing the straight-man in comedies and I’ve begun to get sick of him playing the same smart-ass character and even at first it seems like it he is just going to fool me once more but his character evolves as the movie goes and so does his performance. Jason’s character Simon is not a good person at all and more and more is revealed about his past as the film goes. Rebecca Hall was also great playing Bateman’s wife who has her own troubles and is a interesting character to watch. I understood a lot of her issues and she did a great job and she steals the show in some scenes. Finally Joel Edgerton could’ve played any role in this movie and he chose to play the villain, and I think he made an excellent choice. This film is a little unorthodox because there are points when you really aren’t sure who the villain is because Jason Batman character is also a terrible person and sometimes you want to feel bad for Edgerton. I loved Edgerton’s performance in this movie and I have been a fan of his since I saw Warrior where he starred alongside Tom Hardy. Edgerton also did an excellent job of writing the film, he has the sole writing credit and this film does not drag out any reveals and it has some really great twists and turns that leave no lose ends. It may lose some of its re-watch ability because of these turns, but it is still an excellent watch. The Gift is a very respectable film for a first time director."" ]";4;6;4;2;0;0

Tom Hardy is the new Max and this is the role he was meant to play. This movie is going to make him a household name and not just \""the guy who played Bane\"".

There is such a strong cast in this movie. Mark Ruffalo shows off some talent that I had never seen from him before. Keira Knightley has some potential to become a real star in the future in my opinion. Then we have Adam Levine who had some limited screen time but I enjoyed every minute he was there. I would like to see him in some more movies, and you don't have to be a Maroon 5 fan in order to appreciate his role.

Hugh Jackman is fantastic as Wolverine as always, but I found that James McAvoy stole the show as the young Charles Xavier. Michael Fassenbender was extraordinary as well.

That is something to be proud off. Sandra Bullock also plays one of the best performances if not the best performance of her career. I need to watch more of her stuff. Plus the supporting characters are just so good and the family is just so cute like Tim McGraw is like the perfect father figure.

I think he was truly perfect, and it is one of the best portrayals I have ever seen and although I liked Mystic River as well I think Murray's performance beats out Sean Penn's for the 2004 Academy Award. There is also an amazing performance by Scarlett Johansson who was only 18 years old when this film was released, this role displays a mature woman far beyond her years and it would be nice to see a performance like this in the future.

Tobey Maguire is great as Spiderman and Peter Parker and I think he has gotten a lot of undeserved hate since the series was rebooted. As soon as you watch this film you member how good he was and it is difficult to say that Andrew Garfield is more suited to play Spidey.

Freeman's career really starts in this movie while Jessica Tandy's essentially comes to an end (she died in 1994). Her performance resulted in a well earned Oscar.

He has been on a roll after some great performances in Prisoners and Nightcrawler last year. Gyllenhaal has been aggressively hunting for his first Oscar nomination and even more so after being snubbed last year for Nightcrawler. This performance may not be better than Nightcrawler’s but Soutpaw is a completely different film and its not just an acting showcase but its also a great achievement for director Antoine Fuqua. Gyllenhaal showed a lot of dedication for his role by working incredibly hard in order to get in shape. He has never looked this fit in any other film."", """", ""Forest Whitaker is also outstanding in this movie. He is just the perfect fit for a boxing training.

Rachael McAdams was great in this movie and 50 Cent. Who knew 50 Cent was actually a good actor? This is definitely the best role I’ve seen him play."", """", ""Southpaw is certainly one off Antoine Fuqua’s best films.

Boxing films do have their clichés and Southpaw does not completely avoid them. There are some resemblances to Rocky, Million Dollar Baby and other boxing films, but for the most part I was able to overlook that because of the great performances and direction. The other small issue that I had with this film was the young girl played by Oona Laurence. I know that kids are not easy to work with and this young girl was really good in most of his scenes but there were just a few issues in some scenes and her performance just wasn’t quite consistent.

Kylo Ren seems to have become more experimental with the force which was a must for this movie. We needed to know that the force itself had grown over thirty years and it did. Adam Driver finally shows that he was worth waiting for as he has stood in most of his recent movie roles but really needed one big part that would demonstrate his talent to the world. Kylo Ren draws inspiration from Vader, which was apparent by his appearance, but he is easier to empathise with than Vader was in his first film. Kylo Ren is the son of Han Solo and Princess Leia, which is revealed fairly early in the film which makes him even more appealing to the audience. I also like the fact that they are looking to ride Driver for at least another film. One of the things I always disliked about the prequels was that it seemed like they were getting rid of their villains too quickly. Then when Disney bought the franchise I was worried that Star Wars would begin taking more of a \""Marvel approach\"" with villains, but Kylo Ren seems to be sticking around."", """", ""Then we have the old cast. Han Solo is the member of the original cast that gets the most screen time outside of maybe Chewbacca who is once again on point like he always has been. Han Solo managed to age beautifully as a character but he also maintained those elements that you will never forget. Harrison Ford will always be Han Solo and his performance in this film is as good as it was in any of the originals. He also contributed a lot of humour. Leia gets a bit less attention and I'm okay with that, but I think there is going to be more involvement from her later on."", """", ""Now to the hot topic among everyone who has seen this film already. Han Solo's death at the hands of Kylo Ren (which I had spoiled for me). I think it was perfect. It did not come without warning which I think works because it gives the viewer enough time to come to terms with what it about to happen. I believe that Harrison Ford chose to sign on for The Force Awakens on the condition that Solo got the death Ford wanted back in Return of the Jedi. I think that a death of a old cast member had to happen just to prove that they were not invincible. Solo's death has an impact on the characters kind of like Obi-Wan Kenobi's death in Episode IV."", """", ""I thought the lightsabre duel between Finn, Rey and Kylo Ren was great. It showed that Kylo Ren is still learning to master the dark side and that he will likely come back even stronger for episode VIII. As a fan I wanted to see Luke Skywalker pop in to save the day, but I think that leaving him out did better for the story overall and it completed Rey's arc."", """", ""Finally the film ends with Rey coming into contact with Luke. It results in a cliffhanger that really doesn't both me that much. Empire Strikes back left a huge cliffhanger and that only made the film better. Luke's in the film for essentially 10 seconds but getting a look at that character for the first time in 30 years gave me chills. Luke's involvement in the next film will almost be certainly bigger and I already can't wait."", """", ""The Force Awakens gives you enough of the new and the old as well as the surprises of the original trilogy.

This is just a fun film. All of the main cast members of the original film return for the sequel and the chemistry is as good as ever. The comedy is great I love the jokes that are scattered throughout the movie. Robert Downey Jr is of course amazing as Iron Man but he is just so funny in this movie and this is probably the funniest I've seen him. One of the downsides of the original film is there is not quite enough Hulk but there is lots of him in this film. The action sequences are amazing and there are so many stunts in the film that leave you in awe. Hawkeye gets more attention in this film as well and we learn more about his character which only makes the movie better. After this movie Hawkeye may not be considered the dud Avenger. Plus there are great classic performances from Chris Evans and Scarlett Johansson. Now there are also some new additions which I think are all added well and all are good strong characters. Quicksilver was certainly an interesting character I liked the effects they used when he ran and I also enjoyed Scarlet Witch who has already been confirmed as a returning character in the future. Then we have Vision who is amazing but doesn't get as much screen time as I would like but will likely play a bigger part in the coming films. Finally we have the villain Ultron. Ultron was not what I expected but he was not a disappointment either. James Spader does an excellent job for the voice but when I watched the trailer it looked like Ultron was going to be a villain we could love that was dark and complex. He is more sarcastic and funny than anything. I liked Ultron but I did not love him. The only other problem I have with this movie is I thought it needed to be longer. Director Joss Whedon has said already that the film was originally 3 hours long but 40 minutes were cut. I hope that when the film is released on DVD and Blu Ray we will get a chance to see the directors cut and I may even enjoy it more. This movie could very well be my personal favorite Marvel film and so far it is my favorite movie this year.

Larson is undeniably likeable and brings such realism to her role. It will be interesting to see what her next projects will be. Then you got Jacob Tremblay, who delivers one of the best performances I have seen from a child in all of film.

Many characters resemble the classic characters in the original film and there are several shout outs to the 1993 classic throughout the film. Chris Pratt said that this film was a film made by a Jurassic Park fan for Jurassic Park fans and that could not be anymore true. The dinosaurs look great, and the action is so outstanding that I had my popcorn finished before the movie was halfway done. Chris Pratt offers a bit more star power than this franchise is used to and he proves that 2014 was not a fluke for him. He does not show the level of humour that he had in Guardians of the Galaxy but he is still very funny and he grabs your attention in his scenes. Bryce Dallas Howard was also amazing and I really enjoyed her performance. There are also great supporting cast characters like Vincent D'Onofrio and the comedic relief Jake Johnson. What prevents a perfect score for me is the overuse of the original films magic and I found that the two young boys in the film take up a little too much of the screen time and although by the ending you can tolerate them, they are kind of irritating for the first few minutes.

Its so self aware. No one is safe from the jokes even Ryan Reynolds himself. Ryan Reynold's has worked so hard to get a screen version of the true Deadpool character and all his hard work truely paid off. Reynolds is Deadpool now.

I feel that The Revenant is even better than Birdman. The film is so raw and powerful and its visually stunning regardless of the scene. Leonardo DiCaprio has become an actor that we expect nothing but excellence. Not only is this one of DiCaprio's best performances but I think that there is almost no way that he does not take home the Oscar for Best Actor. The Revenant may sweep many of the major categories at the Oscars.

All of the elements of the film are necessary, although it could’ve ended earlier, but it does result in a film that drags. Characters and plot points will be present for a while and then disappear for over an hour. There are a lot of people and places the film needs to cover and while it is all essential, especially in regards to setting up who the prisoners are, it does result in a film that is a tad unfocused and lengthy. So ultimately it comes down to is it worth it. Should Speilberg have taken the time to establish who all the prisoners were so we care about them and its not just some guy that captured at the expense of a flowing narrative. Or should the film have cut down on those sequences streamlining the film but making it a tad harder to connect with the film. There is no easy answer to this question. Nonetheless, Speilberg and the Cohen brothers, who apparently helped write this film, do their best to balance the film and result in something that while not something I’d want to go back and watch again as its not a fun blockbuster is well made and will likely be in the running for the Oscars.

The film is long but it is mostly justified. The only slow part is the first act, which while necessary could’ve been trimmed. Otherwise the film remains intense as you try and figure what will happen and who is lying and who is telling the truth. The revelation at the end provides rewatch value as you will see the film in a whole new light knowing what is going to come.

This film was able to deliver a tightly written story that was flawlessly paced without sacrificing content from the book, brought out the best of every character, and was really well shot. I often complain that film adaptations of a book rush through their story leaving out various character and plot points well this film doesn’t. I thought that splitting Mockingjay into two movies was a dumb cash grab and that’s probably what Lionsgate thought to but this movie made it work unbelievable well. This is one of the best film adaptations of a book I’ve ever seen. The film stayed true to the book without taking out anything significant and nothing was underdeveloped. The quality of this film makes me wish other film adaptations would follow similar suit and split their books into multiple films as it could lead to better storytelling (ex. the later Harry Potter films). Lionsgate’s financial decision not only has brought them more money but a better story than it would have otherwise. This film reminded me how much I loved the first half of Mockingjay and showed how to make a great adaptation of book. This might be spur of the moment but I might even go so far as to say not only is this the best of the franchise but this is right behind the Lord of the Rings trilogy as one of the best film adaptations of a book ever. This is the third book the one that got weakest reception combine that with threequels tending to suck this film shouldn’t have been this awesome but it was. Well done Lionsgate well done. Curious if Mockingjay Part II will follow similar suit.

Big Hero 6 is a great film that provides Marvel fans, Disney fans, and movie fans in general with a great experience rivaling that of a Pixar film. The supporting characters could use some development but with any luck this film will get a sequel that will explore them even more. Until then I will continue to watch this film as I eagerly await the next Disney film as this studio has regained the magic they had in the 90s. Hopefully Pixar can pick up the slack with Inside Out but regardless its glad to know there is animation studio on top of their game again!

The characters are likeable nothing amazing but I enjoyed them. The presentation is nice but nothing spectacular. What stands out in this movie are three amazing songs the best I’ve heard from Disney in years! I will admit it is not as iconic as The Lion King or Aladdin but hey it is hard to make a masterpiece and for what they did they did a pretty good job. It is hard to take the Disney formula and constantly make it feel fresh and new but they managed. The reason why some people may not like it is because they enjoy other variations of the story. Also, these guys aren’t Pixar nor do they have the original team that did the 90s Disney movies. I will admit it is not Disney’s best but it is still an enjoyable film the best of the year in fact and the best animated film of the year thus far (although The Wind Rises will probably win). If you are a Disney fan you’ll enjoy yourself and if you are along for the ride you’ll get through it ok. As for me this the best of the new age of Disney and it is a shame the film is being marketed as a dumb comedy. It may not be their best but has some great stuff in here that impressed we in ways that Tangled didn’t. Frozen didn’t have the greatest animation or funniest side characters but its story engaged and surprised me and had some fantastic songs and atmosphere. While Pixar’s films have declined in quality (from excellent to good/ok) Disney’s films have gotten better. They aren’t the greatest but it is enjoyable to see it done again and well if I might add.

The scenes that Jackson gets right he really gets right. There is some great moments in this film like the last one. While Two Towers still has some of the same problems as Fellowship, the characters and story are much better and the stuff that is good is really good creating a movie that is stronger than its predecessor and makes me excited for Return of the King, which some consider to be the best in the series."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

What makes this film stand out is the fact that the film takes its audience seriously and does not dumb itself down for the sake of appealing to kiddies. The film is gritty and has interesting message. Plus, it has likeable, interesting, and realistic characters who while insects are human in their personality. This film showed the world what Dreamworks could do that Disney and Pixar did not at the time. They were not afraid to make something edgy and was more for kids than adults. This film has great writing and sophistication that puts it above a lot of animated films both at the time and even today, including some of Dreamworks’ recent films. As a result, Antz is a great flick that I highly recommend checking out.

The beginning is information overload and could turn some people off. However, once the Joker shows up and chaos ensues the film really picks up. You get into the story, which is great. The film is enhanced by some great performances especially by Heath Leadger. While some of the acting could have been better it is still good and nothing terrible. The story is lengthy and may have benefited from being two films; but it did not bother me as much the second time. The further you get into the film the better it gets. Overall, The Dark Knight is not just a great superhero movie but a great film. It has a deep story, good characters, and some nice filming to top it of. If you have not seen this film yet check it out its great. You do not have to like Batman to enjoy this film. It is an interesting take on some well-known characters and I love it.

It’s a nice feel good movie. My only issues come from the last third/fourth of the movie where we have to sit through a lot of arguing as well as moping and doping even though its obvious that the film will end on a happy note and what that note will be specifically. Since this is a Robin Williams movie where he plays a teacher that inspires a pupil, I feel its fair to compare it to Dead Poet’s Society, which is a better film. I found the arc of the students’ in that film to be far more interesting and I like how the happy ending comes at the cost of some tragedy. Additionally, that film was not as predictable. With all that said though I still enjoy Good Will Hunting it’s a heart-warming film with a good message that pulls at your heart strings. It makes you laugh and cry as well as remember a time when cell phones did not exist and the Dunkin Donuts logo looked different. It is cliché and predictable but I’m willing to overlook it because the characters are likeable and the relationships are fantastic especially in the first half (second half/third is where the clichés fall in).

Leonardo DiCapprio embodies the character he plays to the point when I’m not thinking to myself that’s Leonardo DiCapprio that’s the Inception character. The score and direction are great. Most of the characters don’t have much too them and the score is a little too much like Dark Knight and is overshadowed by the wakeup music but those are issues that I can easily overlook. It is rare that I can just sitback and enjoy a film without thinking of critiques, the score I’ll give it, etc because Inception has microscopic problems. This film is awesome it blew me away and truly ranks as not just a great film for Nolan to add to his resume but one of the greatest films out there. I loved watching this movie and I can’t wait to see it again. With more and more viewings this could become one of my favorite movies. With Nolan having a film this awesome under his belt I cannot wait for Interstellar because films like this prove how awesome of a filmmaker he is.

It’s this willingness to be honest and harsh that makes this film go above and beyond a kind of distance that I haven’t seen form an animated film since Toy Story 3. Any gripes about the film’s conflict resolving too quickly or having too many reveals are issues that could easily be resolved with repeat viewings and knowing what’s happening. With Zootopia Disney have once-again surpassed themselves in the non-fairy tale CGI films. With the track record continuing to be great as Disney’s films continue to improve and evolve the biggest concern is whether the next film will be as great as the last one. Disney’s biggest competition this year is themselves with Moana a musical the question now becomes can it be as great and timeless and classical.

And that complimented the atmosphere that felt claustrophobic, isolating and at times terrifying. Talking about spotlight of the film - Ava was a fascinating mind and a character that I couldn't stop dissecting, trying to understand her motivations, feelings and always had the nagging question - \""Is she truly conscious?\"".

Christopher Nolan did a breathtaking job of portraying this absolute distinction of Batman and the Joker. What makes Joker work is not only Heath Ledger or Christopher's realistic approach of this madman, but also small bits and tributes of every Joker before this one (going from Ceaser Romero to Jack Nicholson, also Joker from animation series and from \""The Killing Joke\"") and also a new distinct personality, all together mashed into this psychotic rage.

It boasts originality and sophistication, thought provoking story telling, visually it's spectacular, the set pieces are thoroughly enjoyable and all round the performances are as equally impressive. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is one of my favourite actors in recent years and he's brilliant here. I was pleased to see him take centre stage after a successful run of supporting roles. And Bruce Willis actually looks interested for a change and he gives his best performance in years. Emily Blunt is strong also and I was surprised to see underrated actor Jeff Daniels in a supporting role for the first time in years. Most Sci-Fi's attempt to be as big and loud as possible. But tonally I think Looper hits a similar chord to Terry Gilliam's 12 Monkeys. It's an impressive, ambitious and intelligent piece of filmmaking from Rian Johnson. And to the films credit it doesn't get carried away with an excessive sense of scale and it doesn't over complicate itself with too many unnecessary characters and multiple distractive plot threads. Also it balances the action perfectly knowing exactly when to throw in a set piece for good measure. Looper is a thoroughly enjoyable piece of filmmaking and I'm intrigued to see what the likes of Rian Johnson and Joseph Gordon-Levitt do next. Collapse"" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

Joss Whedon clearly has a love and understanding of these characters and the source material. He collaborates all of these stars to perfection and balances their screen time effortlessly. His overall direction is solid and all of the set pieces are thoroughly enjoyable. The final act in particular is unbelievable and incredibly crowd pleasing. The whole cast is strong but Robert Downey Jr. is the standout as Iron Man. Tom Hiddleston is as equally superb as villain Loki, Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow & Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury have much more involvement and most surprisingly Mark Ruffalo is a welcome recasting as the Hulk. Chris Evans & Chris Hemsworth are both strong also and have grown into their characters Captain America & Thor respectively. However my only minor criticism is Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye. Personally I didn't like the way his character was developed throughout the film until the final act. And I hope his character has the chance to shine in future releases. But otherwise as a lifelong fan of these characters I was both pleasantly surprised and incredibly satisfied. The Avengers caters for everybody, it's action packed, full of humour and it will please fan boys and newcomers alike. This is without a doubt Marvel's best film to date and it epitomises the success of the Phase 1 films. And even more excitingly it kick starts Phase 2 perfectly."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

Marvel took a risk on the source material considering that the characters aren't as well known as the likes of Iron Man, Hulk & Captain America. But the overall execution is flawless. These characters are all perfectly cast, instantly loveable & absolutely hilarious. Chris Pratt's Peter Quill a.k.a Star Lord is one coolest anti-heroes ever and you root for his larger than life character because he has such human and relatable qualities that bring him down to our level. His character pleasingly had a vibe than reminded me of classic heroes like Han Solo & Indiana Jones. Zoe Saldana's Gamorra is a worthy heroine, Bradley Cooper's voice work for Rocket Racoon is hilarious and Vin Diesel's Groot steals the show. Most surprisingly Dave Bautista is brilliant as Drax the Destroyer, he brings a real physical screen presence and he adds witty and dry humour. Michael Rooker, Peter Serafinowicz & John C. Reilly are all fun and worthy mentions also. Sadly the only characters who feel underdeveloped, generic and forgettable are the villains. But otherwise this is one of the funnest films I've ever seen. One of the most successful elements of the film has to be the soundtrack. The Awesome Mix Vol. 1 tape is pure genius and it feels like a character in it's own right. It's definitely one of the best, most varied and most inventive soundtracks of all time. Featuring tracks from the likes of 10cc, David Bowie, Jackson 5 & of course Blue Swede. The set pieces are all thoroughly enjoyable and visually this is a very entertaining film. But what sets this film aside from the wrest of Marvel cinematic universe is the genius use of humour, banter and bickering between the characters. And unlike the the wrest of the Marvel films to date, this feels more like a comedy that features great action and set pieces, rather than an action film with segments of humour thrown in. The Guardians of the Galaxy made me laugh and smile from start to finish and sentimentally I'll forever love this film."" ]";0;1;0;1;0;0

Personally I thought the spectacle of Interstellar evoked the same sense of scale and wonder only previously achieved by Stanley Kubrick in '2001: A Space Odyssey'. Matthew McConaughey gives a solid performance and he carries the film effortlessly. He perfectly balances portraying both a hero you can root for and a Father you can relate to. And his relationship with his on screen daughter Mackenzie Foy is both touching and incredibly human. Anne Hathaway & Jessica Chastain are strong also and Michael Caine, David Gyasi & Casey Affleck are worthy mentions in supporting roles.

Visually it's jaw dropping and the cinematography truly captures the enormity of this film. And once again Hans Zimmer's score is absolutely stunning and it's just as integral as the visuals when creating the cinematic experience. However there are undeniable flaws and many would argue that the ending feels like a bow that's been too neatly tied. As a piece of filmmaking it feels like a battle of ambition versus logic.

An ambitious marriage of astrophysics (thanks to Producer Kip Thorne) & just the right amount of wonder, this might just be Nolan's Magnum Opus. Featuring his trademark mind-bending twists & turns, time & time again he keeps the similar tricks feeling fresh because he never pigeonholes himself into the same genre & subject matter."", ""There certainly must be something to his \""one project at a time\"" philosophy. With it he has established himself as the most consistent blockbuster filmmaker in Hollywood, & the studios trust him enough to let him develop original films with enormous budgets. In the Hollywood climate of adaptations & brand building, Nolan is an anomaly. He also has the respect of his colleagues. Just a few of the filmmakers who have come forward to endorse Interstellar include Paul Thomas Anderson, Edgar Wright, & Quentin Tarantino. Undeniably, part of their endorsement is because of the love of film cinema that they share with Nolan. He filmed Interstellar entirely with 35mm and 70mm IMAX cameras, & consistently rejects the idea of switching to digital cameras, whilst the studios & production companies have long ago made up there minds. But Nolan uses his leverage to help keep celluloid alive in the industry. Interstellar was released only into theaters that could still project film two to three days before any digital theater."", ""Nolan clearly has an undying love for what cinema stands for, & Interstellar is his most astounding example of this yet. This time he has used the trust he's gained to truly outdo himself. Whether it's presenting complex scientific & theoretical concepts in the story or strapping an IMAX camera to the front of a Learjet, Interstellar pushes all of the limits. Nolan has crafted a timely, thoughtful, & visually brilliant film that is arguably his most cerebral & undoubtedly his most emotional. This will come as a welcome surprise to those that have long accused Nolan's films of being emotionally cold. Such is not the case here."", ""At the heart of the film is a father-daughter story that had me emotionally invested almost as quickly as Pixar's Up. The beating heart of the emotions lie in standout performances across the board; the genuine portrayals & intimate characterizations ground the entire film with necessary sentiment & well timed humor. Fueling the carefully crafted visuals & emotions is Hans Zimmer's beautiful, visceral, & emotive score. As promised, Zimmer abandoned many of the techniques he has used, & been lampooned for, in his past collaborations with Nolan, to a much fresher & sublime effect."", ""Interstellar is ultimately a film that revels in the simple idea that we are here, & how amazing it is that we have the ability to wonder, contemplate, & actually understand the way the cosmos works. The film begs to question mankind's level of investment in it's own ingenuity & ability to pioneer. Unlike Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, which focuses on the frailty of humanity & lacks any form of sentimentality, Interstellar puts its full faith in mankind & harvests many meaningful thoughts about humanity's role on earth & among the cosmos."", ""The film is personal to me because in the year leading up to it, I have been striving to become more scientifically literate & environmentally conscious through such means as Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey. Just as in a socially cognizant society, there is no room for anti-intellectualism or ignorance in the world of Interstellar. Perhaps the greatest role this film could play is in promoting science consciousness & curiosity among audiences that could hopefully bleed through into society as a whole. That may be dreaming big, but the reality of humanities current situation certainly didn't go unnoticed by anyone involved with the production of Interstellar, nor should it the viewer."", ""It may be a work of fiction, but the environmental apocalypse scenario presented in the film is no less feasible & frightening in the real world than it is in the film’s plot; undeniably more so. Sure Interstellar takes a few creative liberties, especially towards the end, but it gets a vast majority of the science correct, & plays joyfully in the sandbox of theoretical possibility."", ""It's very hard for anyone to walk away from this film questioning the legitimacy of the events that take place in the film, especially if you are fan of other fantastical Hollywood films. Just the mere fact that the film is largely based off of Newton's laws of physics & Einstein's laws of relativity should be impressive. Alas, at 2 hours & 49 minutes chocked full of complex concepts, there are certainly those who may check out at a certain point. But they would be remiss to not feel the impact of the finale.

With the sweetly touching, skillfully underplayed performances by Joel Edgerton and Ruth Negga (both of whom will surely see Oscar noms) their situation is rendered even more poignant. Some may find the pace slow, but I found it quietly compelling.

The first half is spent in their confined environment before expanding the drama to examine their crisis in facing the real world. Without ever resorting to easy or expected devices, this film is sweet, touching, suspenseful and moving. Director Lenny Abrahamson has brilliantly created an intimate story that's powerful, yet understated. The best film I've seen this year."" ]";4;4;4;0;2;0
steve-jobs;8;TVJerry;/user/TVJerry;Oct 29, 2015;"[ ""Unlike the typical biopic, screenwriter Aaron Sorkin has set this one backstage just before the launch of 3 different products (Macintosh, NeXT, iMac). While the tech gets a nod, the focus is on the man and his relationships with 3 primary people (Steve Wozniak, John Sculley, his daughter Lisa). Sorkin has brilliantly combined a lot of information into a crowded, time-limited backdrop. Director Danny Boyle has added a frantic, intimate style to keep the focus on the people (all of whom are superb, esp. Michael Fassbender in the title role and Kate Winslet as his \""work wife\""). While demonstrating Jobs' genius, this film clearly shows his gruff professional style and challenges with relationships. A fascinating, informative and compelling glimpse into his life."" ]";2;6;2;4;0;0

He became known as Lily Elbe, one of the first known transgenders to also undergo sexual reassignment surgery. Redmayne is perfect for the role, not only because he makes such a beautiful woman (more so than the real thing: see below), but because he’s such a gifted and brilliantly expressive actor. His delicate nuanced portrayal is exceptionally touching. But this story is about both of them and Vikander also turns in a moving performance. The locations are lovely and the dresses gorgeous, but every plot development takes too long to unfold. Even with the languid pace, this film is a quietly sweet and beautifully tender examination of love and self expression."" ]";1;2;1;1;0;0

He determines to stay alive by using science, ingenuity and pluck, while NASA strategizes on rescue plans. Unlike \""Gravity\"" (which it will be inevitably compared to) this is more about science than suspense. Solutions are methodically discussed and tried with few setbacks. Despite this more intellectual approach, Damon's performance is spirited, amusing and occasionally touching. Director Ridley Scott manages to make the moving parts and technical explanations acceptable, while mining a bit of emotion and even humor in the interactions. Overall, it's a well-crafted and captivating tale of human survival."" ]";1;3;1;2;0;0
macbeth-2015;8;TVJerry;/user/TVJerry;Dec 17, 2015;"[ ""You probably know the story, but it's never been told like this. First, it's been re-imagined with a more rustic, less grand style...often raw and dirty. Second, almost all of the dialogue is intensely introspective, no booming soliloquies here. Despite that, the performances are raw and passionate. The Scottish brogue sometimes makes the dialogue difficult to follow and the concentrated, deliberate pacing becomes a bit monotonous. Finally, the liberties with style are striking! In addition to the staggering Scottish landscapes, DP Adam Arkapaw has shot every scene with visual power that gives \""art film\"" a whole new meaning. The dialogue has been trimmed to make room for some beautifully shot (often in slo-mo) battles, quiet moments of ceremony and other evocative stylings. This is brilliant realization and masterful revelation of cinematic imagination."" ]";1;3;1;2;0;0

This one revolves around a young teen in 80s Dublin who forms a band to impress a girl. The resulting group of misfits is cute in their awkward innocence, while the period style and music pervade the film's atmosphere. The band performs a number of original songs (by Carney) that prove to be catchy pop fun. In addition to the musical treats, it's a truly sweet story of a young man's efforts to express himself and his love. Sure, you can bask in the nostalgia of MTV's early days, but you'll also find yourself charmed by the film's buoyant youthful optimism."" ]";1;1;1;0;0;0

When tragedy strikes, he and his crusty \""uncle\"" (Sam Neill) set out on an extended adventure in the bush, which causes a massive manhunt. There's a quirky charm to the characters and a wacky edge to the story that makes is sweetly charming.

This brutal journey is intensified by director Alejandro González Iñárritu’s masterful vision for capturing the harshness of nature and malevolence of men. Some of the sequences are technically astounding. Add to that the incredible scenery and immensely beautiful (mostly available light) cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki. DiCaprio suffers with extreme commitment, but it’s the almost unrecognizable Tom Hardy, whose menacing villain is the acting standout. Even with the 3-hour running time, the intensity never slacks and the skillful storytelling creates a harshly compelling cinematic tour de force."" ]";3;8;3;5;2;0

It's a sweet story with the inevitable hankie moments. The performances are genuine and the script is appeals with drama and humor.

Toss them in a blender and you have the inevitable fight to save the world. One of the things that makes this more enjoyable is that each hero's abilities are used in interesting ways, instead of the typical massively-destructive battles. The character interaction is usually engaging and best of all, there are no long scenes of metaphysical hand-wringing or interpersonal drama. Most of the encounters are brief and compelling. The action sequences are well staged, even sometimes cool. After 2.5 hours, the last 20 minutes drag down with muddy conclusions, but it's still one of my favorite superhero flix. Of course, stay thru the credits for a very confusing setup."" ]";1;4;1;3;0;0

This film tells the amazing story of 3 of these exceptional women (played by Octavia Spencer, Taraji P. Henson, Janelle Monáe). The spunky script peppers the continuous indignities and inequities that are heaped upon them with humor that adds warmth and humanity. Their performances are all winning. This film is fascinating in its exploration the early history of our space program, but it also delves into the discrimination against these women in an easy to swallow, entertaining package.

The story starts in 1939 Poland, where the titular character (Jessica Chastain) and her husband (Johan Heldenbergh) lovingly care for the inhabitants of the Warsaw Zoo. When the Nazi's invade, their secret mission to shelter Jews takes the story in a dark direction. All of the actors are strong and director Niki Caro has created a mostly-compelling experience. The inhumane treatment by the Germans cast the appropriate despair and the brave actions by the zookeepers are  intrepid. Even though the subject matter has been covered many times, this film still manages to tell this true tale in with potent results."" ]";1;1;1;0;0;0

This means moving back to his small hometown where he left painful memories behind. This is a sensitive story with loveably gruff characters who have a hard time expressing their feelings and often hurt instead. Affleck and Hedges are powerful in their subtlety and restrained emotions. The script by Kenneth Lonergan is intelligently crafted with eloquently mundane observations, while his authoritative direction is detached, yet sensitive (look for him in a cameo as a man on the street who berates Affleck for his lousy parenting).  This compelling drama is impressively skillful and quietly affecting."" ]";0;0;0;0;1;0

Ryan Reynolds is the perfect actor to play the role. He smartly nails every clever quip and witty observation, plus he’s easy on the eyes. The script is by the guys who penned “Zombieland,” so that gives you an idea of the non-stop wise cracks and smart pop culture references that fill the dialogue. The comic-book-style action is edited with a rapid-fire pace, but unlike so many modern fights, you can follow every punch. The approach is irreverent, sarcastic and very funny. Reynolds’ delightful character, the wonderfully twisted sense of humor and the inventive approach to a stale genre combine to create the most entertaining Marvel Comic flick yet."" ]";1;4;1;3;2;0

With Interstellar, Mr. Nolan set out to make his most personal and emotional film to date about love and time (time being a recurring theme throughout all of Nolan's films). But it's so much more than that too. There are no words to express the epic journey Nolan takes us on in the film, but needless to say, it's tear-jerking and emotional throughout. The acting is top-notch, especially McConaughey, who gives (I would say) his most emotional performance yet. But the actor who stole the show in a few scenes (one in particular, when they're on an alien planet) was David Gyasi as Romilly, one of the astronauts aboard the Endurance, their spacecraft. The musical score from Hans Zimmer is, without a doubt, his best and most influential work to date, helping drive the film's bold and breath-taking vision (the church organ helped significantly). The visual effects are easily the best to date as well, and of the year. To see a black hole created through visual effects in such a way, with pages theoretical equations provided by Kip Thorne (theoretical physicist, of whom's work inspired the film's genesis); what you see in the film is the most realistic depiction of a black hole, and even offered new insight to accretion discs surrounding the anomalies. But even everything else, from the alien planets to the Endurance, the visuals always look real. Then, there's the writing. I would definitely have to say this has some of the best dialogue i've ever heard in a sci-fi movie, and the script continually pours or oozes emotion, keeping the audience tethered to the film."", """", ""Now, about Mr. Nolan. Don't just look at Nolan, but look at his films. Some say Inception would be his masterpiece, while others would say it's The Dark Knight, or Memento. But honestly, every single film Christopher Nolan has directed is a masterpiece not of its genre, but of Nolan. Following is his quiet masterpiece, not the film that put Mr. Nolan on the map as a phenomenal director, but one people visited or revisited after becoming accustomed to Nolan, after seeing Memento, what could be called his breakout masterpiece. Then, right after, he directed the remake of the Norwegian thriller, Insomnia. This, too, could be considered a masterpiece, even if a remake. Then, we were given his take on the Batman universe, starting with Batman Begins, the origin masterpiece. Then, there's The Prestige, adapted from the novel of the same name, which can be called his dark masterpiece. The Dark Knight, his bold masterpiece; Inception, his complex masterpiece, and The Dark Knight Rises, his flawed masterpiece. Now, we have Interstellar, his emotional or personal masterpiece."", """", ""This is just my looking at Nolan and his films, but whatever your thoughts are, you can't deny Interstellar is one hell of a journey. He certainly is one of the best filmmakers of our time, and of all time. I can't wait to see what he does next, but i'm not sure it will be as emotionally powerful as Interstellar."" ]";1;2;1;1;0;0

His movies have repeatedly been original (which, among all the remakes, sequels, and reimaginings that are so prevalent now-a-days, is unfortunately quite rare) and Interstellar is no exception. It's a very unique film that touches on a subject that has somehow rarely been touched upon. Namely, the intricacies of how worm holes and time travel truly might work and how the human race might utilize them to aid in its survival. This movie doesn't need to rely on flashy special effects (though they are quite good). It doesn't need to fill each moment with action in order to tell a story (I'm looking at you Michael Bay). And it doesn't insult the intelligence of the audience by providing too much detailed explanations from the characters as to how worm holes and time travel work. There are a few scenes where they touch on the subjects, but Nolan assumes that his audience is at least reasonably intelligent and can not only understand the concepts by direct monologue, but also from inference by what's being portrayed on screen. There are moments which someone who is nit-picky might find to be far fetched, but this movie isn't targeted for such an audience. It's targeted towards those who can reasonable suspend their disbelief enough to catch the point the movie is trying to portray. In fact, the movie is less about the science and the theory, but more about the characters and that \""what-if\"" factor. The acting is simply superb. I found my manly self holding back tears in one scene, and giggling like a fool in another. To this date, I have yet to watch a movie which Nolan has put out which has been anything but fantastic.

But the big question is: can TDKR fulfills the incredible expectations that surrounds it? No.   Is is a great super hero film? Yes. Not as great as TDK but better than Batman Begins. It is surprisingly the most 'comic book'-ish of the Nolan trilogy, with twists, revelations and storyline in line with its source material.  Great cinematography and superb technical detail, great soundtrack (albeit a bit overbearing), and most important of all, some great action sequences. I dunno about you though, I feel that Anne Hathaway's Catwoman is the most accurate portrayal of the character ever filmed.  Tom Hardy's Bane is not as interesting as the Joker (thanks to Ledger's supreme performance) but he is still a menacing villain.  The biggest weakness: one of the plot point during the climax is a little bit too similar of a recent mega blockbuster of late. Nolan also creates too many characters and plot points: it lacks the efficiency and focus of his previous works such as Inception and yes, TDK itself.  Worth seeing, but the TDK is still the best comic book film of all time. Lower your expectations a bit, film nerds!!"" ]";2;5;2;3;0;0

What helped a lot was that the parents did love their children, and that the children knew they were loved. Woody Harrelson did an excellent job of making his awful character sympathetic.

Matthew McConaughey has done a great job to do this role. after slight introduction of human crisis Nolan tries to enter deep into charecter who lost his job, wife etc. the main charecter then enters to a voyage of script !. humanity is facing blight , human raise is struggling to produce food. every nation shut down their resources. whole of a kind is trying to make food.

dawn-of-the-planet-of-the-apes;9;Mattyice;/user/Mattyice;Jul 12, 2014;"[ ""So far, this summer, movie wise, has been pretty meh. Some movies, like 22 Jump Street and X-Men stood out to be great films, but some have been poor. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is not only a great film, but a masterpiece that far exceeds all of its predecessors, from the original film to the good prequel Rise of the Planet of the Apes. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is flawless in every way possible, from the plot to the CGI. The acting was generally solid, but nothing too special. However, Serkis is unbelievably good as Caesar once again and Toby Kebbell is even better as Koba. The plot created by Matt Reeves and co. is action packed, smart, emotional, and, in general, beautiful (for the lack of a better word). However, the apes were the stars of the show. Caesar, Maurice, Blue Eyes, and especially Koba were all great and each took on significant roles in the film. Lastly, the CGI. The effects in this film are the best I've possibly ever seen in a film. It was so realistic you would think the ape actors were in costumes. In general, this film is a must see this summer and easily turned an OK movie summer to a great one. This movie will make your summer."" ]";8;14;8;6;0;0

There are a lot of good things about the movie, but the main thing that kept me engaged throughout the entire film was the plot. The sinister plot and multiple twists actually got me to say \""Oh s**t\"" at several moments during the film, but the plot did have a couple of holes, but none of them were detrimental to the film. I wanted the kidnapping/revenge mystery to keep going on. In addition, the characters were performed very well by all. No actor/actress played their role badly and the development of these characters makes you feel for them even more. Overall, this film is definitely worth seeing right now."" ]";2;6;2;4;0;0

Not only does the film feature the great action you'd expect from a marvel flick, but this film had comedic elements that were missing from many marvel films over the past few years. The Acting/Voicing by all of the main cast members (specifically Pratt and Cooper) was fantastic, giving us a very good depth of their characters. The best part of the film, however, was it's humor. The humor in this film was fantastic, making it a much funnier, lighter, and better entry than the previous two out of Marvel Studio (WDSMP), Captain America: The Winter Soldier & Thor: The Dark World.

Catching Fire is excellent entertainment but it's the deeper plot and societal references that will grab you and keep you long after the action has faded.  I didn't read any of the books, and as much as I'd like to after seeing the first two movies I almost want to hold off to maximize the impact of the movies. Maybe a \""10\"" isn't a balanced score, but I am hard pressed to think of a movie in recent memory that had me so wired and on the edge of my seat.  Jennifer Lawrence is fantastic and the cast surrounding her all turn in great performances as well.  This Hunger Games is more visceral - I didn't want it to end, ever. We'll get Mockingjay to close out the trilogy and I was thrilled to hear that it will be a two-part movie.  It's just sad to think that there can only be one more complete chapter in what has quickly become the coolest franchise since Harry Potter, especially as The Hobbit has turned out to be nothing special.  To Danny Strong (screenwriter) I say: do us proud - Suzanne Collins' oversight will do wonders to keep the movies faithful, but it's your transition from literary fiction to silver-screen entertainment that needs to land the most.

Not a moment goes by that feels overly bland or useless - quite the feat given the 2 hrs. 50 minutes total runtime.  Interstellar does carry a lot of science and theories that are used throughout the film to make sense of what is happening.  This gives a lot of creative license to Christopher Nolan, who progresses the story through creativity without ejecting audiences uncontrollably. The great thing about Nolan's approach in Interstellar is that we can't really say for sure he's right or wrong, because the movie operates on existing facts and theories in regards to space and time.  But what really anchors this movie is the sentiment of relationships - of how love is an immeasurable force that has yet to be quantified or measured in any meaningful way.  And, without using dialogue or narration, the \""5th dimension\"" experience later in the movie is somewhat explained by the final seconds of the film (not a spoiler) - something I think people could have missed on a first pass.

This is Reeves' Ape series at it's most emotional and powerful. The performances and motion capture are still in top form. There's even Steve Zahn this time around to give Andy Serkis a run for his money in both categories. It's got the bombastic energy of an action film, the brutality of a serious war movie, and the heart and soul of a compelling human drama. This conclusion to the Reeves trilogy is excellent and hands down the best of the reboots. While the door is left open for more to potentially come from the series in the future, War is good enough to serve as the conclusion of the Apes films. It's satisfying and a whole heck of a lot deeper than what typically comes to theaters these days. It does a lot you wouldn't expect.

If Daniel Kaluuya does not get on Oscar for his performance here then something has gone horribly wrong. His performance as a guy who is just trying to make the best of an awkward scenario, but slowly losing his ability to as things get progressively stranger is nothing short of absolutely believable. The rest of the cast is game as well. They're manipulation and bizarre behavior set you on edge in ways few other movies can. The scenes are lovingly crafted and the choice in music that accompanies them is spot on."", ""It's the originality that ultimately wins the day. First time director Peele toys with your expectations in interesting ways. He's done so since before the movie even came out. The social-commentary in regards to racial tensions is something that stirred up a lot of controversy. There are people who won't even give the movie a shot as a result. Their loss. The satire not only shines light on some significant social issues, but is excellently weaved into the plot as a reason to make the main character uncomfortable with meeting his girlfriend's parents in the first place. Needless to day, partially because so many others have said it, it's not racist. Not some middle finger to white people or anything like that. But, whatever. Not gonna bother talking about it any further. People have already made up their minds on what they think this is about."", ""If the movie has one flaw it's that you can kind of pick out the twists before they happen. Don't get me wrong, there are still surprises in store. It's just that the big reveal as to why exactly all of this is happening is evident right before it is revealed. It was too well telegraphed to not become immediately obvious. Then there's the bit that has to do with a significant character to the plot. It was obvious what was going to happen there from the trailers. Still, plenty of weirdness and questions you'll find yourself asking (which will get answered)."", ""The movie is essentially an awkward introduction to being introduced to the parents of a significant other. The difference from this and, say, the Ben Stiller comedy \""Meet the Parents\"" is the horror angle. Instead of increasingly upping the humor, Get Out ups the mystery, tension, and uncomfortable nature of the events. Speaking of the humor, it's worth noting just how surprisingly funny the movie is. Most of it comes from Lil Rel Howery, the main character's best friend. He serves as the comic relief and is given some absolutely hilarious lines that are well acted. Simply put, Get Out is one heck of a horror-comedy and a stunning directorial debut from Jordan Peele. I can't get over how talented the cast is, the unique and well-shot scenes, the clever ways it plays with expectations, and just all around uniqueness. Get Out proves to be a standout in the ever crowded horror genre. It's rare these days to see a movie in this genre so well made. It's becoming more common, but still far too infrequent.

Who would've thought a kids movie would be the one to examine the effects Batman's past tragedies have had on the character and the way his self-destructive life style blurs the lines between hero and villain. It's the most mature and meaningful bit of Bat-fiction in years, and it's been brought to life with animated Legos and family-friendly humor. The animation style is still really interesting. The screen does regularly get cluttered, making it hard to keep track of what's going on during some of it's larger action scenes. The voice cast is phenomenal and I loved the new takes on classic characters. There are also plenty of nods to Batman's long history in both comics, TV shows, movies, and much more. The amount of obscure Batman villains alone is sure to bring a smile to the face of any longtime Batman fan and excite the imaginations and interest of those who haven't heard of them."", ""The story is simply great. It shows us Batman's relationships (or lack thereof) with the heroes and villains around him and asks the question of whether or not he can ever open up his heart and find a family. The humor is spot-on. The jokes come at you in a near-constant stream of hilarity. It tackles a wide variety of humor and always comes out on top. A perfect movie for Batman fans of any age. Don't make this mistake of missing out of this because it's \""made for kids.\"" There's something here for everybody because it is so deceptively deep. Deeper than pretty much any other movie about the character with maybe the exception of the Nolan trilogy.

It makes things more exciting."", ""If there is one flaw to the action it's that the hand-to-hand combat falls back on the old 'watch our hero flip a guy by his arm' trick too often.

I can't think of another time where it's been this much fun watching people get shot in the head. There also may be an issue with the actual writing. Personally, I didn't notice this, but one person I know who watched it mentioned how it felt like they had seen it before because they could predict how everything was  going to play out in the final third of the film, right down to the dialog. Not a big deal in my opinion either way because of how strong the action is. Besides, it's not like the first John Wick is known for redefining plots fo rthe action movie genre."", ""If you wanted more John Wick then Chapter 2 will most certainly deliver. It has got some of the most exciting fights and shoot outs around. Plus there is style to spare. With a lot of great side-characters and villains to fill in the world and more details into all these rules Wick must follow, there's new here to go along with the familiar.

For a movie already strong in plot, action, and character it is amazing just how much Fassbender does to bolster all of it's strengths and abilities. He takes things to another level and the movie goes to show his outstanding ability as an actor. He's not the only notable person onscreen though. While everyone else is pretty much playing the standard character roles one would expect in this kind of movie, there is Danny McBride really stepping out of his comedic comfort zone in favor of a surprisingly emotional performance.

You'll notice influences from a lot of other genres outside of the standard comic book movie affair. Sometimes it feels like a western, others like a family drama, and even like an end of the world type of film. Yet, at the end of the day it's a character driven story.

There's plenty of potential to go forward in new ways as well as a new middle chapter to flesh out thanks to the still game-changing effects of Days of Future Past. The difference now is that they are going to have to move forward without Hugh Jackman, which should mean no Wolverine as well (who wants to follow that act?). A pretty big challenge to overcome given that even the movies that weren't stand-alones were very Wolverine-centric. So long as the people behind these movies can keep things as unique and well-executed as this movie, then they'll be okay. Regardless, our last outing with Wolverine (at least with Hugh Jackman in the role) is a grand one.

The laugh-out-loud funny moments and excellent performance by Daniel Radcliffe also helped."", """", ""It's more emotional and weird than one would have guessed even with the absurdity of the premise. It's clear that the film is in on the craziness going on. There's a tone of self-awareness. However rather than tripping over that knowledge like so many other self-aware films do, \""Horns\"" uses it to add some believable humor to the mix. It's darkly funny to watch people confess and act upon their deepest and darkest secrets, as it should be."", """", ""While the humor and magic inherent to the tale are appreciated, what really keeps you invested in unraveling exactly what happened to \""Iggy's\"" (Radcliffe) girlfriend is the heart of the tale. All the betrayal, mystery, drama, and questioning really wouldn't mean a thing if the audience wasn't convinced that Iggy really did love her. Radcliffe once again delivers another stunning performance to make sure that we do."", """", ""Obviously the horns are a big part of this \""Gone Girl\"" style flick. Without the magic there wouldn't be the humor or the touches of horror that help give it the edge. I was really interested in figuring out just what caused the horns and other supernatural elements to go on in the first place. That's where the movie kind of stumbles. While it delivers every explanation you want for the actual murder story, we're left in the dark as to the supernatural part. It's really the movie's only disappointment for me. Given the religious undertones surrounding the horns and other powers there could have been yet another layer of depth to the film."", """", ""Unfortunately that isn't the case. It's kind of let down, but the rest of the movie is so good I can't fault it too much. It's an emotional, darkly funny, sweet and deranged story that brings several genres together to create something new and exciting. With another stunning performance by Radcliffe who is backed up a (mostly) stellar cast we have another delightfully weird movie from the Harry Potter star that has the potential to charm in new, strange ways. While I can't speak for everyone I can say that it did hook me and I highly recommend giving it a shot."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

I expected it to suck, after I saw that they changed Spidey's suit I was sure they were going to ruin Spider-Man, but after seeing the movie I'm proud to say that it's fantastic. Yeah they changed the suit, and while I'm still not cool with it I have to admit it's not a bad looking suit. They did add a few more elements from the comics this time around. Peter is a high-schooler, has web-shooters this time around, and Gwen Stacy is the love interest this time around, and they all make the movie feel fresh. It's the same origin story we saw in the first Spider-Man movie back in 2002, but they manage to make their own changes to these familiar scenes to make them different rather than a complete retread. A big addition to the series is the mystery behind Peter's parents, which is something I can't wait to see where they take it. The movie is fantastic and Spidey fans will not be disappointed, however it does have some flaws, they left out Spider-Man's spider sense, and didn't include the classic \""With great power comes great responsibility\"". While leaving out Spidey's spider sense isn't really a big deal at all, just noticeable (and to be honest I really didn't miss it), the fact that they left out those powerful words from Peter's Uncle Ben (at least in my opinion) is horrible and never should have happened.

Night of the Living Dead holds up remarkably well after all these years. If anything, with the exception of (maybe) the low budget and some inexperienced acting, time might have actually improved this movie. It's black and white visuals, retro soundtrack, and to the basics approach add a tone and atmosphere to this that the refinements of the modern age can't always capture. I will admit that there is a lot of what I guess you could call empty space in the movie. The majority of the time is just watching the characters (mostly just Ben) board up the house they are trying to survive in. It isn't until the cast expands that the action really starts to get going. Like most zombie movies, the struggle survivors find between each other as the result of differing backgrounds and personality is just as large and dangerous to them as that of the undead hoards gathering just outside their defenses. One of the many examples I could cite to show you just how influential this movie was to the countless others of it's ilk that followed in suit."", ""While the low budget, independent nature of the film is something of a two-edged sword, it's clear that one edge is much sharper than the other. Fortunately, it's the one the swordsman doesn't have to worry about cutting (or worse, impaling) himself on. Without a great deal of special effects to rely on, we actually get to see the cast really use tools like fire and such to survive. It's pretty amazing to see our lead use a legitimate torch indoors, smoke and all, on his was outside. It makes the situation more believable. Yes, he's not actually going out there to ward off zombies, but he is risking some burns with that flame. The movie might actually be even creepier due to this smaller scale as well. I particularly enjoyed how the zombies were portrayed without much makeup, making them look more like, well, people. It's their behavior that sets them apart. I also think the way Romero envisioned them is also neat. They are much smarter then what we normally see nowadays, as they have the gumption to do things use tools in basic ways. It's also worth noting how incredibly bleak things are. With it's unforgettable ending and disturbing basement scenes, this is a movie that will stick with you long after you've made it to the final screen. Unlike other zombie fiction, this one even gives us an idea as to what caused the dead to return to feast on the living. Night of the Living Dead is a piece of cinema history. A real game changer that is still influencing the world today. Even though the zombie craze has slowed down a bit as of recently, the undead are still dominating our world. Well, ladies and gentlemen this is where the outbreak started. The late, great George Romero has gone down in history for a reason. You really should check out this starting movie in a series that has still has the ability to enchant and chill even today. Zombie fan or not, horror fan or not, movie buff or not, if you consider yourself a fan of fine cinema then this a must watch. Not only is it historic, but it's also fantastic as well. One of the most important, influential, and just darn enjoyable horror movies ever created."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

Spider-Man and the X-Men were doing fine, and even Blade did well enough to get himself a trilogy. The rest of the Marvel heroes though? Not so much. They were met with poor reviews and disappointed fans. Even The Punisher was met with critical backlash, although for the life of me I can't see why."", ""It's an awesome origin story that plays out as a superhero revenge story. It's dark, brutal, and Thomas Jane absolutely nails it as Frank Castle. There are even some nice bits of dark humor, scenes pulled straight from the comics, and is just as violent as one would expect a Punisher movie to be. Unlike Daredevil it actually manages to nail the mature, gritty tone. Something a lot of superhero movies have struggled with over the years and even still do."", ""It's interesting to see how many familiar faces were pulled from Punisher comics to fill out the supporting cast. The movie offers quite a bit of fan-service for those who are clued in. The mob family Castle sees himself fighting against feels a little generic, and Travolta is surprisingly flat as the main villain, but none of that gets in the way of how satisfying the violence is. It's also got an old-school feel. Revenge has never been quite so satisfying."", ""Yes, the early 2000s weren't the kindest to a lot of Marvel's characters. The critics took shots at The Punisher that honestly feel undeserved. During a time when Daredevil, The Fantastic Four, and even Hulk were failing to do those classic characters justice (they really tried though, I'll give them that), The Punisher stood tall and delivered. It's one heck of a satisfying revenge flick, a bleak vigilante tale, a throwback to the gritty action movies of the 70's and 80's, and something truly different from every other superhero movie out there.

Oh, and it's about falling in love."", ""The thing holding the movie together is Adam Sandler's incredible performance as \""Barry.\"" The movie really shows why Sandler should step out of his box more. He even outshines the incredibly talented and critically acclaimed director behind the whole thing. Dare I say it, if Paul Thomas Anderson had tried to make this movie with anyone else other than Sandler, the results probably wouldn't have been this good. It would have been harder to overlook the nonsensical moments the director throws in or his intentionally cheap, amateurish camera work (most evident in the way it pans the screen). All of which feels kind of pretentious. The remarkable thing is that none of this really feels all that far out of Sandler's wheelhouse. It's not the majority of the stuff he's been in hasn't had him playing as a character with anger problems before. The difference is that the material here is just deeper and requires more range from him. It's amazing that more people aren't taking advantage of this. That they can't see what Anderson saw in him. I don't blame other people in Hollywood kind of losing faith in him and not wanting to give him a chance based on all those critically panned comedies he's made over the years. Especially lately where even as a fan I have to admit he hasn't been trying as hard as he used to. Still, it's not as though he hasn't come out of his comfort zone following this. He's shown he can rise to the occasion for more serious material in film's like Reign Over Me or Spanglish, among others. Come one people, throw the man a bone. He's still got it in him to deliver movies like this."", ""Punch-Drunk Love proves to be a meaningful, romantic, and at times outright hilarious dark comedy that features an outstanding performance from an actor who most people wouldn't and still don't think is capable of one. The movie even manages to get it out of him while playing to a few of his expected strengths in the process. Simply put, the movie gives one of cinema's biggest critical punching bags some good material from a proven director and lets us watch him rise to the occasion.

However when it comes to getting believable performances from all of the cast, he stumbles. Actors like Ewan McGregor, Sir Christopher Lee, and Samuel Jackson do good to great jobs at their characters, but some of the cast just give poor performances. The worst offender is Hayden Christensen. He's awkward, stiff, and wooden. An offense made even worse by the fact that he's playing Anakin Skywalker. You know, Darth Vader himself. The big star of the series."", """", ""Perhaps though some of the more unenjoyable performances can be blamed on Lucas as a director. Either way they help to add to a certain cheesy feel of the movie. Also adding to it is the occasionally awkward dialog.

However, it's the two biggest ones I am going to focus on for this review. Because without them the movie's other successes wouldn't matter."", """", ""The first becomes almost immediately apparent. The characters here are real people. They make real decisions and act like a real family. Elements of the film make it part horror-comedy because of how realistically it portrays how people act. It makes it easy to get involved in their plight. You'll actually care about these characters, unlike the faceless morons you'll find in today's horror films."", """", ""The second is originality. Even today after all these years there is still nothing like it. A trend I've noticed a lot with the old horror classics. Some would say we don't see horror films like this anymore due to the progression of time leading to new forms of style being needed for the genre. I disagree. There is a sense of imagination to the scenes that we don't see anymore. Crazy crap happens here that blows all of the lame jump scares and similar looking specters that plague the horror flicks of today out of the water. Not too mention the themes it tackles. Something the vast majority of more modern horror movies don't do at all."", """", ""A return of this style of horror movie would be most welcome. As far as the actual horror itself goes, I personally did not find it scary. Still with this level of creativity and intelligence put into the visuals and scenarios, it's so unlike anything else I've ever seen before that it barely bothered me at all."", """", ""It's an excellent horror flick. One that I wish more modern directors would take cues from. It's got believable characters, a fantastic story, and that wonderful sense of deranged imagination. There are scenes here that will stick with you long after the credits have rolled even if you didn't find any of it scary, because you'll find yourself thinking about them and saying \""wow, I've never seen anything like that. Why don't more movies try something like that?\"" It's one of the best examples of how to do the genre right and because of that even after all these years it feels remarkably fresh. Who knows, it also might just scare the wits out of you. There are plenty of reasons to watch it and I recommend doing so as soon as possible."" ]";1;2;1;1;0;0

carrie-1976;9;TheQuietGamer;/user/TheQuietGamer;Jul 11, 2017;"[ ""A pretty faithful adaptation of the Stephen King novel. The ending is different and nowhere near as explosive (literally) as the one in the book, and you'll also likely notice some different takes on a few characters as well. Yet, little of what made that tale so powerful gets lost in the move to the big-screen. The heartbreaking nature of the events are expertly captured and Sissy Spacek is a darn-near perfect Carrie despite being as skinny as a rail post (in the book the character is a touch overweight). She carries the heart and sole of the character with her awkward, sympathetic, and ultimately powerful performance. The movie is sure to strike a chord with anyone who has ever been bullied. It also serves as one of the best anti-bullying messages there is. No, not because Carrie eventually has her revenge on all those who tormented her. Instead it is because of the ability the story has to make us feel what Carrie feels. Her loneliness, hurt, fear, and embarrassment are channeled into the viewer thanks to Spacek. Her performance has the power to express what the character is going through beneath the surface almost as well as the words on the pages on the novel do. It's incredible stuff and makes the final act all the more riveting and crushing as we watch Carrie rise only to be let down again."", ""As a horror movie it is both beautifully shot and not very frightening. The real terror comes not from jumps on the screen, but from the at times awful nature of our fellow human beings. The blood certainly does flow in the final act, which is both spectacular and violent, but I wouldn't go as far as calling this a \""scary\"" movie in the traditional sense. It's the subject matter that makes it a part of the horror genre. It's also worth noting how beautifully shot this is. It's an excellent recreation of the book even if liberties have been taken and alterations have been made here and there, ensuring that it isn't a 100% faithful adaptation. These deviations aren't really a big deal. Yes, the book is a masterpiece, but this movie does so much right that it most certainly stands on it's own as it captures so much of what made the book so incredible."", ""It's a heart-wrenching story and I think one of the best darn horror movies ever made. Certainly a contender for the best Stephen King adaptation. You owe it to yourself to see why this movie and character are so iconic. It's a quality offering in just about every way. It's emotional events and grisly finale will stick with you long after the credits have rolled. It manages to be both touching and horrifying. Human and monstrous.

The kid deserves a lot of praise. His excellent performance really sells that Mowgli is interacting with live animal as opposed to CGI ones."", """", ""The story itself is still excellent.

finding-dory;10;TheQuietGamer;/user/TheQuietGamer;Dec  8, 2016;"[ ""I, like many, was apprehensive about the idea of a sequel to the Pixar masterpiece Finding Nemo. It didn't really seem like there was room for a sequel in the universe, and with the exception of their Toy Story series Pixar has left me disappointed with it's sequels. However, while Finding Dory is definitely not as good as it's predecessor, it is a welcome return to the aquatic side of Pixar movies."", ""First off it's a stunning reminder of how perfect the original is in terms of animation, characters, and casting. Dory and the gang are just how you remember them and the voice acting is still some of the most incredible I have ever experienced. The cast adds nuance and life to these characters using only their voices. The animation is nothing short of gorgeous. Things like returning characters and references serve as humorous and appreciated throwbacks to the original."", ""All that said, this isn't one of those sequels that reuses plot elements and jokes from the first movie to get by. It stands on it's own as an incredible animated movie. One with it's own adventure, new characters, and plenty of original humor and heart."", ""Just like the best of Pixar's work, Finding Dory is emotional and heartwarming. The character of Dory is front and center with a stunning core performance from Ellen DeGeneres that quite frankly deserves every voice acting award out there. Now the plot itself does get a little absurd. Characters bounce around through situations that often defy logic. Honestly, I'm okay with that. Because at the end of the day it's still entertaining and you can feel it in your heart. You can also feel it in your funny bone, because it's absolutely hilarious. Simply put, Finding Dory is another masterpiece from Pixar. No, it's not as good as Finding Nemo, but honestly that kind of lighting doesn't strike twice. Instead it's a very respectable follow up that will enchant families and viewers of all ages. And at the end of the day, it still blows away just about everything else out there."" ]";0;0;0;0;1;0
raw;9;TheQuietGamer;/user/TheQuietGamer;Oct 23, 2017;"[ ""College is an interesting time in the life of any young person. For many it's where people truly discover who they are, and usually not without some difficulty. That's what I found the heart of Raw to be. A coming of age story where a girl must find out how to live for the first time upon awakening to her true self. However, her awakening isn't a sexual one like so many other films would have done. Sure, there are moments where she experiences the pangs of lust, but for the most part her desire for flesh is less carnal and more primal. Raw is a movie where the lead character discovers that she is in fact, a cannibal. Marvelously acted and impeccably written, Raw's depiction of the horrors and beauty of college life in spot-on. There's even a little bit of family dysfunction, sibling rivalry, and the struggle of being female. The movie is simply real in it's portraying of everyday life. You know, minus the cannibal angle. The darker side of the movie is grotesque, twisted, and maybe even a little disturbing. It brings the blood and gore, but doesn't go for shock value. It's remarkably mature where other movies have been excessive or even outright silly. Everything comes together masterfully. It may have a few moments of confusing and pretension that are so often present in the more artsy horror movies of it's ilk, but there's an approachability here that's not always seen in these kinds of films."", ""Raw is another example of just how great 2017 has been for the horror genre. It's smart, vulgar, and, well, RAW! An incredibly gripping and effective ride through the college experience and the insecurities that are forced on women by society. There's a little bit of everything here, and all of it is powerful. Raw is nothing less than a new classic in the horror genre. One that should be a must watch for hardcore enthusiasts. It may not appeal to more mainstream tastes, but there's little denying that it's an incredible film for the more discerning among us."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

So Michael Caine's character asks Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) to take a long and dangerous journey into space in the hopes of saving the human race. The original plan was to bring everyone off of Earth and repopulate on another world. But that plan, as revealed in the movie, is not possible. So they are forced to go with plan B, which was to abandon everyone on earth and start a new colony with their frozen human embryos on their ship. But before that part of the story, they visit two planets. A water planet and an ice planet. The water planet is made entirely of shallow water and occasionally has cloud-high waves that sweep the planet and eliminate any life that may be in that area. So... Not the best place to setup a human colony because the original scientist who landed there was most likely hit by one of those waves as well as Cooper's third crew member. The second planet they visit is entirely made of ice and is very visually appealing to the eye. There, they meet another scientist who seemed so grateful to be freed.

Bridge Of Spies is a cold and intense movie that brings us close to the Cold War and how an American lawyer tried to help two hostages by trading him with a soviet spy. But much more than that, the script shows us how close Hanks and Rylance's characters get closer and respect each other's jobs and how much such likely USA and Russia can be regarding spies, even though they are near to start a dangerous war in the world because of their differences. We don't have a lot of depth on Donovan's personal life but the focus on his relationship with Abel is deep and moving, especially in the end. Fortunately, we don't have an over patriotic analysis on the fact, which makes the film easier to relate to and not annoying like previous films about American heroes.

Well I got something to learn next time."", """", ""The story is about a single mom's drama about raising her son, who's behavior deteriorates into violence, due to a mild mental illness."", """", ""I first took interest in the film Mommy just because of the hype and the positive praise it got from the 2014 Cannes Film Festival and the amount of awards it won from the Jutra Awards and Canadian Screen Awards for best Foreign Language film, but not a Academy Award for Foreign Film at the Oscars. Since I am watching more Foreign Language films and searching the ones that got high ratings or just the ones that may interest me, because I'm taking a break from some movies today as they normally not very good or just too Hollywood for me, I mean movies today are getting pretty stale and cliche as nothing feels originally anymore. When Hollywood tries to make a original movie that's down to earth it's laughable. These something about Foreign Language films that always feel real and sometimes so tight with it's story and ending that most movie studios will shy away from and I love it. So I checked out the 2014 Award Wining Mommy and it was absolutely brilliant, I mean how could I even dear overlook this I mean this is a great movie right here and true film making at it's best."", """", ""Not only did the Oscar screw up for not awarding this for Best Foreign Language film, they also didn't nominate Anne Dorval for Best Actress, because she did one of the best, the most heart felt and the most real piece of performance I've seen in 2014. I felt her struggle and the mix relationship between her and the missed behaved son. There was many scenes in the movie were the son and her have this argument over each over and it never felt like I was just watching actors reading out the script and pretending that they related, no they back and forward arguments always felt real and I bough it. Oh and I found out most of the awards that this movie won are not just for the Foreign Language Award but most of the awards went to her and she deserves it and a Oscar too for god shake. At the Cannes Film Festival Julianne Moore won for Best Actress for Maps to the Stars and I haven't seen Maps to the Stars yet so I can't really judge on her performance in that movie since I haven't seen it, but Anne Dorval was nominated in that category so it was disappointing that she didn't take the award, but I have seen Still Alice and she won a Oscar for that role, but Anne Dorval should have took that Oscar home as she did a much better than Moore as I connected to Anne Dorval more and how her performance made me feel different emotions that I never felt before while watching the movie."", """", ""Antoine-Olivier Pilon is a unknown star to me as I haven't seen him in any other movies before so this is basically the first ever performance I get to see him in and man god can this kid act, I mean he was so good in the movie. Just like I said about Anne Dorval and that is all the time it never felt like acting to me, it felt real. Antoine plays the misbehaved son perfectly that he actually catches the trouble child very well since I have seen young people like him in real life and how they act is just like him. I also love how they never force the message of \""He's got a mental illness oh feel sorry for him\"". The movie never puts that in your face like most movies do when they try to be realistic or make you feel something for the character. He's performance showed both angry, goofy, troubled and damaged but all that is in he's performance and it never feels force and that was so well done that movie didn't slip into that cliche that happens in most movies and that's due to Antoine-Olivier Pilon excellent performance."", """", ""The director of the movie Xavier Dolan which I haven't really seen any of his last work so this is my first movie directed by him and a great start. This is film making at it's best, I mean the cinematography is beautiful, the tone of the movie can switch to serious drama but quickly change to happy and many other tones and it didn't ruin the movie like most do. Xavier Dolan did both a excellent job on directing the movie and making this as down to earth as possible showing characters and they problems that most people can relate to. Awesome work Xavier Dolan."", """", ""For problems with the movie I haven't really got any to be honest, but I'm not going to give this the perfect rating as I think this isn't on the level of 5/5 rating it can ever get it, but the rating I'm giving it is really outstanding and it's the highest rating I give this week."", """", ""Overall I say that Mommy is worth checking it if you haven't seen it yet. It's worth your time and don't do the same mistake as I did and not watch this fantastic movie."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

It's actually a pretty good movie."", """", ""What really surprise me is how much films David Oyelowo has been in 2014, I didn't take much notice but now I have and I was extremely shocked how he got overlooked by the Academy and the BAFTA, because his performance in this movie is by the best I've seen this year. I didn't just see David Oyelowo being Oyelowo, no I only saw Martin Luther King and nothing else. I can see that David Oyelowo had strong passion for this role that he put everything in it and he absolutely nailed it. David you may not got a Oscar nomination for you outstanding performance but you won everyone over with your acting and you got a bright future a head of you buddy. Great work David."", """", ""Ava DuVernay who to me is a unknown directed. I haven't seen the other work that she did so I can't really say, but after watching Selma I know straight away that we got a good one here, because she directed this movie with has much care as possible and effort to show how bad it was back then and she did it so well her that getting snubbed at the Oscars for directing is crime in my eyes."", """", ""The one thing that makes Selma a truly great movie is the fact that the movie isn't all inspiring or beautifully touching like most Holly Wood cliche Oscar bait movies, no the director smartly takes a different turn for the best and just show what really happened and try not to make it all inspiring and make Martian look like a god like person and all that other stuff that's been done to death now. Selma steps away from that and shows the mistakes that this guy did because let's not forget that Martian Luther Kings was only human, just a guy who's not perfect of what he did and I hate it when Holly Wood takes a real life person and make him perfect and a god to everybody's eyes and when you look up the person in real life you start to see these other stories where he made mistakes then and there and you find out that the movie isn't being truthfully to the real life person, but in this movie Selma takes that cliche and say \""Sorry but that dose not happen. Go away Holly Wood\""."", """", ""Now for problems: Martin Luther Kings was the only interesting and the one person I cared about in this movie, but the other character's I didn't really give a fuss about them. I know I should but really I don't, I don't even remember they names at all. You may find them interesting but I didn't."", """", ""Selma overall isn't just a Oscar bait or too HollyWood movie.

This guy doesn't just like music, he breaths music and he wants his band to do perfect. His opinion and his look on music is another thing why I didn't flat out just hated him, I actually understood him.

Now his character in this movie has the love of the true art of music and you can see that he will wants to tell people his love for music, but when the harsh life of reality comes crashing into him it's truly heartbreaking to see his struggle and effort just not being good enough, and Teller played this character so realistic and so brilliantly flawless."", """", ""The directing and the writing in this was just....perfect.

Now the biggest cliche that I always hear from critics when their talk about a different movies and their use words like \""You will clap at the end\"", but you don't, or \""You will feel inspired after the film\"", and I you don't. But Whiplash actually did make me feel inspirited towards the end and made me clap. It's message of not giving up and the dream that you been chancing for isn't just going to come to you. Movies like Pride, freedom Writers and all that such never ever give me that inspiring feeling inside of me, until I watched this movie."", """", ""For problems: The movie had it slow parts and that's it really."", """", ""Whiplash is a movie that everybody should see. This isn't just a popcorn movie where you come and put you legs up and laugh a couple of times, no this movie reaches out to people out there that have the same problems that these character's have, with their passion of what their what to do in life get's over shadowed by something you don't want to do and this movie get's it right.

the-revenant-2015;10;MattBrady99;/user/MattBrady99;Jan 11, 2016;"[ ""\""My heart bleeds. But revenge is in the creator's hands\""."", """", ""The Revenant is set in the 1820s, in the uncharted wilderness of America, Hugh Glass set out with a hunting party on an expedition. Glass was mauled by a bear and left for dead but through sheer will and to get back to his family, Glass survived - but that wasn't the only thing on his mind as he set out to payback the men who left him behind."", """", ""I remember last year around January time when I saw the two images for The Revenant, with Leo holding a Kentucky Flintlock Rifle looking like he's not playing around. Just by those two images caught my interest. I then found out it was directed by the magnificent Alejandro González Iñárritu who did the Oscar wining \""Birdman\"" (A movie that I personal loved). The Revenant quickly became my most anticipated movie of 2015, as I was looking forward to this movie more than Star Wars, and yes I said it. And after finally seeing the movie myself, I can safely say that I was not disappointed. The Revenant is one of the most stunning, brutal, intense, grizzly movie experience I've ever had. The movie isn't for everyone, but I loved it."", """", ""Alejandro González Iñárritu is starting to become my 3rd favorite director working today, because he's such an old school director when it comes to storytelling by the use of art. There's been a lot of drama happening behind the scenes of this movie, with the weather stopping the production or if someone made a mistake while filming, the crew must stop for the day and wait until tomorrow, because one mistake could lose a lot of day light for a scene (It was shot in natural lighting). One of the studios suggested that the movie should be shot using computer generated to make things much easier, but luckily Iñárritu said no to the idea by stating, \""If we ended up in greenscreen with coffee and everybody having a good time, everybody will be happy, but most likely the film would be a piece of **** And after seeing the movie I gotta say that it was the perfect decision, because it's very rare for a director today to take that risk and avoid what the studio says. Yes there are some CGI scenes, but the way that the animated effect's blended together with the practical effect's is handled incredibly well. This is one of the best directed I've seen in 2015 and I know Iñárritu already won an Oscar already, but I hope he wins another one for this, because never before have I seen a revenge tale presented so unique and utterly magnificent."", """", ""I respect Leonardo DiCaprio as an actor, but in this movie, he sleeps inside of a dead horse naked and eats raw food from animals, now if this doesn't get him an Oscar, nothing will. He's performance in this movie is what a call ''a silent performance'', because Leo barley has that much lines in the movie and the only time he dose get to talk is in a different language (Which Leo has said it was tricky to learn the language). DiCaprio has proven time and time again that he's more than the pretty face actor, but in this movie I only saw Hugh Glass, not DiCaprio. That's my biggest praise I have to give to Leo as he had to deliver all the emotions, the pain, the tortured soul that Hugh Glass was and it's all through his face and eyes, and trust me when I say this but it's not easy as you think. We are so use to seeing Leo as the angry, pretty boy billionaire in every movie he's in, but in this movie I thought he was fantastic, as he played the man who lost everything and the tortured soul that Hugh was as a person was. With very little lines he had, he still manages to make a powerful performance that's so far his best. I really hope Leo gets an Oscar for this."", """", ""Tom Hardy also gave an Oscar worthy performance in this movie. I've heard that some people had trouble understanding him in this movie (Or just in everything that he's in really). Sometimes I didn't understand what he said but most of the time I did. But all that a side, I still think he was fantastic in the movie. He really added a lot to his character, because sometimes you understand the things that he dose in movie and yes the things he dose in the movie are wrong, but in a rough environment that these people are in, you would likely do the same. I'm not sure if he would get in for best supporting actor, but I hope he dose."", """", ""I'm running out of things to say about Emmanuel Lubezki breathtaking cinematography. The camera work and how he makes the camera feel like a character of it's own is seriously impressive. Lubezki captures nature on film, that shows it's beauty and it's unpredictable surprises. The people running the Oscars should just give Lubezki his third Oscar right now, because he's going to take that third trophy home."", """", ""Now for the flaws and there's not that many for me: Some of the character logic towards the end of the movie didn't make that much senses to me, and that's really it."", """", ""Overall The Revenant is one of most intense, stunning, brutal movies I've seen in 2015. The score is haunting, the editing was top notch and that bear attack scene was just terrifying, I mean how the hell did they do that?. I don't know about you, but I honestly can't stop thinking about this movie. It's one of those movies that sticks with you after it's over and it isn't going away anytime soon."" ]";3;8;3;5;1;0

Logan achieves what all other Wolverine-Centric X-Men films all failed to do: make you actually care about what the heck is going on in this ultra violent, ultra science fiction world. Gone are the extremely convoluted, over-ambitious science-based plot points and bloated cast of mutants. Instead, everything is focused on exactly what is most important to this story: Wolverine, Xavier, Laura. All the fat of quicksilver and blah, and who else can we squeeze into this terrible story to make an extra buck--it's all been cut out. This is a mature film; it goes down like a sip of properly aged whisky: bold, sophisticated, and not for the faint of heart. The only real complaint I have is that the ultimately bloody end of this film felt abrupt after watching the film once; I was expecting an additional 5-20 minutes to completely solidify the end of the most favorite X-Men character's arc. Instead, we get a fairly quick last moments of Wolverine with his daughter, the two finally using the familial terms they never had the privilege to use, and then he's buried. That's it. Maybe it's because the movie was so good that I wanted more? Eh, I'll just buy it when it gets released from home entertainment. Even if you were as skeptical as I was about this movie, go see it.

The core point of this film, and this builds gradually and gracefully throughout, is that sacrifices must be made in order to accomplish your dream(s). This film captures exactly what LA is - a wasteland populated by transplant dreamers too full of regret to not be bitter, to not be made jaded and cynical from a city that will chew you up and spit you out faster than you can scream for help. And its people; self-centered, and ambitious--constantly treading water just to keep their head above water in the hopes that they'll be alive long enough to find their own island of success. If anything, trying to find and maintain true love does, in fact, become the antagonist--just as it is in this film. At the end of the day, the inevitable choice must be made over the questions: why did you move here? What do you really want? To boot, performances by all were incredible. The soundtrack is perhaps the best in a decade.

Miles Teller is a total revelation to me in this and shows how such a young actor can be an outstanding one already. Amazing performance. A crime that he has not been nominated for best actor at the Oscars. Co-lead actor J. K. Simmons is equally great and will win his Oscar for supporting role no doubt. And the film does this with just two main characters, music and a great screenplay. No more is needed when we are talking about real art. It will be impossible because of politics, but if this film gets the Oscar for best picture it will be the biggest deserved surprise in Oscar history. A must see!"" ]";1;1;1;0;0;0

The first part \""Rise of the Planet of the Apes\"" was surprisingly good, when nobody seemed to care after the disaster of a movie that Tim Burton created years ago. It was emotional and beautiful. Now, this second part of the new reboot manages to surpass expectations and gets the whole reboot to a new level. It keeps being very emotional and with a lot depth, but also, it gets dark and intense, even brutal in some way. It´s very well thought out and makes you want more after an intense but soft ending. It feels short and you are in the moment it starts thanks to the incredible new world they show us, with apes riding horses and haunting. It´s spectacular and rough.

By the last hour I was absolutely surprised at how much I was loving the experience. Only bad thing I can say is some of the make-up doesn´t look good, but even that was probably done on purpose. Each one of the stories adds something different and are totally enjoyable. I felt like the futuristic ones could have been a film on its own, with great and innovative special effects. The film is truly memorable, I plan on watching it several times in the future. My favorite story was the boy who was a musical genius, that was the one with more heart and with the best acting in my opinion. But really, all the actors are on point, and it´s absolutely incredible to think how they even managed to put all this together and make it work. Outstanding body of work, emotive, epic, funny, sad and everything in between. What an experience. One of those very few cases when I strongly disagree with the critics rating.

Firstly, what I think it´s the most important thing is that the film has a HEART, which is very rare to see in most Marvel movies (thanks Sony and thanks Spider-man). The emotional content is strong and ends giving us a climax that is one of the most impacting scenes in comic book films history, it is truly memorable in fact. The cast has to be the best in a comic book film ever, with Andrew Garfield showing he is the best for this role once more, Emma Stone stealing the show as a very strong female character (Gwen Stacy), Dane Dehaan (probably the best young actor along with Andrew in Hollywood right now) and Shally Field. The chemistry between them is crazy. Then there´s the stunning visuals, the film is so bright and colorful. One of the show stopping moments comes thanks to Electro in Times Square, ridiculously fun. I found the score to be great too (something Marvel movies usually lack). Hans Zimmer is a genius, so no surprise there. In addition to all of this film gives as some closure when it comes to Peter Parker´s parents in a very tense opening scene and later on too. The problem some people seem to have is that there are many things going on, and I understand that argument, but at the same time it did not bother me at all.

It is in my opinion the best performance of 2014, over Eddie Redmayne and Michael Keaton. The film is a little bit by the numbers like any biopic is but in this case it all fits wonderfully and the dialogues are very clever, and by the end, the importance of the story being told grabs you and does not let you go. I was ready to give it a very strong 8 out of 10, but I am very surprised at the staying power it is having on me, typical of great films with a lot of depth and layers which become more impacting after letting them sink in your head,  so I have to give it an unexpected 9 out of 100.

Many movies that tell a true story simply go through the motions, relying on everyone's recognition of the events to do the heavy lifting, but not Foxcatcher.  Bennett Miller directs it with tension, detail and cinematic flourish.  Steve Carrel proves to be a more than solid dramatic actor.  He's creepy, strange, and yet somehow still garners sympathy.  I'm not sure what his performance would seem like without all that makeup, although I'm sure it would still be more than adequate.  Ruffalo and Tatum are also great, and maybe even better than Carrel, but he does stand out more due to his odd and sometimes villainous behavior.

the-dark-knight;9;BradySmith;/user/BradySmith;Jan 21, 2013;"[ ""The dark knight is one of those very rare films that transcends its genre.  It's more like an actual crime thriller than a comic book movie.  It's dark, well acted, at times unerving, and probably as close to reality as a superhero movie can be.  Nolan's direction, especially in the action department, is nearly impecable.  The cinematogrophy is also excellent.  As everyone who seen this knows, the best part of the film is Ledger's joker.  It's probably the most disturbing  take on a familliar character ever devised.  However, I due have some nitpickings.  If you've seen the crow you know that Nolan has borrowed a few elements from that film including the look of the joker.  One other small problem is that when Bale is dressed as Batman in a scene where he is just talking to someone it seems kinda silly, especially with that voice he makes.  Also, in my opinion, Maggie Gyllenhol, (I think that's how you spell it), is too ugly for her role.  But ultimately the film is so far ahead of its superhero movie counterparts in terms of screenplay, directing, acting, and cinematogrophy that these things don't leave much of a negative impact.  It's a film that everyone needs to see, even people who can't stand other films in this genre."" ]";0;1;0;1;0;0

They direct it with such obsessive detail in every little action that it's impossible not to be impressed with their work here.  I like a lot of their movies, but none of them can match this one's sublime mix of violence, story, and character.  Anton Chigur has to be one of the top five screen villains of all time.

I would give his cinematographer's name, but even though I know it, I know I'd spell it wrong.   I've heard the movie Paprika had a great influence on Inception so I don't quite know exactly how original it actually is, but rest assured, it's definitely unique among mega budgeted action films.  With it's arthouse sensibilities, huge scale, impressive visual effects, ambiguous ending, and enough (possibly) pseudo intellectuality to give Freud a headache, Inception marks a new era in blockbuster filmmaking, and will permanently cling to the deep recesses of your mind."" ]";0;0;0;0;1;0

The story may have been done many times before, but it's still very engaging.  There are moments that are powerfully charged with emotion, the direction is flawless, and the scope and scale are both breathtaking.  There is also an extremely resonant atmosphere throughout.  James Cameron has created what is quite possibly his best film.  It's an instant classic, full of deeply human and resonant emotion, groundbreaking visuals, and viscerally stunning action.  My only real complaint is that the dialogue can be somewhat clunky, but the rest of the movie quickly sends this to the realm of nitpicking.

Upon my second viewing however, I realized that there could have been a couple more of these types of moments placed into certain parts of the film.  The drama is all very well executed, but sometimes the movie does go a little too long without any action.  But this is still a film that hits you on much deeper levels than any action scene ever could.  Its ambition, imagination, and humanity are nearly unmatched.

The genius of Burgess was being able to put so well and forcibly, yet in such an entertaining way, so many issues that, had most anyone else set forth on the endeavor, would have come up with the type of off-putting, heavy-handed sermon that would never have reached such a literary pinnacle, and been required reading even now, generations later.

The best example I can give *MAJOR **** SPOILER AHEAD* was when Dr. Brann (Brann? Brand?

The creators said it was because they wanted to make the emotions clear not through dialogue, but through the music.

The monster was my favorite part of the movie, 'Clover' is an original creature design that is sadly being knocked off in a lot of movies today like in the new 'Godzilla' the Female MUTO moves alot like the monster in this movie and even a few years back with 'Super 8' which was also done by JJ Abrams the monster was really just a smaller version of this one.

Receiving twelve Academy Award nominations, and again winning Best Picture (and this time Best Director for Coppola as well), the second installment has been rightfully hailed as the best sequel of all time."", """", ""The Godfather Part II is a more ambitious production than the original since it attempts not only to tell a pair of completely disconnected stories, but to do so in parallel. The less time consuming of the two presents the early life of Vito Corleone (played by Robert DeNiro) in Sicily and New York, and shows how he came into power. The other tale picks up approximately a decade after the conclusion of The Godfather, and shows the means by which Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), now secure in his position, attempts to expand the family empire into Las Vegas and Cuba."", """", ""Plot and counterplot develop, and Michael becomes the focal point of a web of betrayal and deceit, turned against by those he had sought to protect. Assassination attempts and government probes target Michael, but he fights back using every scintilla of ingenuity he possesses and sacrificing much of his humanity in the process."", """", ""The traditional elements of the Tragedy introduced in The Godfather reach their maturity in Part II. Much of the humanity remaining to Michael at the outset is leeched from him with each deception and setback. Late scenes with a resentful Fredo (John Cazale) and a bitter Kay (Diane Keaton) emphasize the price for Michael of continuing his father's dominion. His flaw is his imperceptiveness and, as is the case for any hero in a story of this nature, its effects are crippling."", """", ""Primarily due to the scope of events, Part II is not as tightly-scripted as Part I. While most of the first film takes place in New York (with a few excursions elsewhere), here the settings vary: Sicily, Ellis Island, New York, Nevada, Cuba, Miami, Washington DC. In letting their characters escape the confines of the \""old neighborhood\"", Coppola and Puzo lessen the intimacy of certain interpersonal conflicts."", """", ""Visually, many of Michael's scenes have a more gloomy appearance this time around. Especially during the latter portions of the film, the don is shown in severely underexposed settings, appearing as a silhouette. His is a voice from the darkness - a photographic mirror of what's happening beneath the surface."", """", ""As the beginning of Part II echoes the opening of The Godfather, so too does the end. Because of the manner in which circumstances are handled and considering the people involved, the impact here is more forceful. The tragic flaw has accomplished its poisonous, inevitable designs. Coppola punctuates both movies with a gut-twisting exclamation point."", """", ""Combined, The Godfather and The Godfather Part II represent the apex of American movie-making and the ultimate gangster story. Few sequels have expanded upon the original with the faithfulness and detail of this one.

As a result, in deciding to film Schindler's List, director Steven Spielberg (Jurassic Park) set an imposing task for himself. His vision needed to differ from that of the film makers who preceded him, yet the finished product had to remain faithful to the unforgettable images which represent the legacy of six million massacred Jews. Those who see this motion picture will witness Spielberg's success."", """", ""The film opens in September of 1939 in Krakow, Poland, with the Jewish community under increasing pressure from the Nazis. Into this tumult comes Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson), a Nazi businessman interested in obtaining Jewish backing for a factory he wishes to build. He makes contact with Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley), an accountant, to arrange financial matters. For a while, there is no interest and nothing happens."", """", ""Spielberg elected to film this motion picture in black-and-white, and it's impossible to argue with his choice. Director of Photography Janusz Kaminski has made effective use of shadow and light, meticulously limiting the application of hue. The opening scene is in color, as is the closing sequence (which features the surviving \""Schindler Jews\"", each accompanied by the actor who played their character, placing a stone on their savior's grave). There are also two instances when color is allowed to bleed into the blacks, whites, and grays. One little girl's jacket appears red so that she stands out from the masses, and a pair of candles burn with orange flames. When color is used, it makes a point and an impression."", """", ""Of course the Holocaust images are grim, but scenes of mass graves and exhumed bodies are not unique to Schindler's List. While it's impossible to deny their power, potentially more distubing are the instances of callous, individual murder. Spielberg doesn't spare his audience when it comes to sudden violence or the dehumanizing factors involved in such events. After all, Jews were viewed as \""vermin.\"" Schindler's List is replete with moments like this."", """", ""The acting is uniformly excellent. Liam Neeson's Schindler is shown in all his complexity, and his transformation is played with studied control. This is no sudden reversal of philosophy, but a matter of conscience that slowly dawns on the man. With a keen sense of Schindler's character, Neeson depicts the metamorphosis from self-centered businessman to driven messiah."", """", ""Despite the grisly subject matter, this movie is essentially about uncovering a kernel of hope and dignity in the midst of a monstrous tragedy. The story of Oskar Schindler's sacrifices for the Jews sets this apart from other Holocaust dramas. Uncompromising in its portrayal of good, evil, and all the shades in between, Schindler's List offers a clear view of human nature laid bare: hatred, greed, lust, envy, anger, and, most important of all, empathy and love. Because this film touches us so deeply, the catharsis has a power that few -- if any -- other moments in film history can match.

According to the movie release schedule, it's December 17. There can be no greater gift for a movie lover than the one bestowed upon audiences by Peter Jackson, whose The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is not only the best movie of 2003, but the crowning cinematic achievement of the past several years. In fact, labeling this as a \""movie\"" is almost an injustice. This is an experience of epic scope and grandeur, amazing emotional power, and relentless momentum."", """", ""One could be forgiven for initially approaching The Return of the King with a little trepidation. As good as the first two films, The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers, are (in either their theatrical or extended DVD versions), movie history is littered with occasions when trilogy conclusions have crashed and burned. Return of the Jedi. Godfather III. The Matrix Revolutions. And so on? Yet, with The Return of the King, Jackson has done more than just bucked the trend. Not only is this motion picture an entirely worthy conclusion to the landmark trilogy, but it's better than its predecessors. Somehow, Jackson has managed to synthesize what worked in The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers, while siphoning off the less successful elements. The result is amazing. Taken as a whole, there is nothing out there today that can come close to comparing to The Lord of the Rings."", """", ""The slowest portions of The Return of the King occur early in the proceedings, as Jackson re-establishes the characters. From there, it's a slow, steady buildup to a rousing climax. The experience is so immersive that I found myself in the middle of the Battle of the Pelennor Fields along with the heroes, rooting for them - even though I knew how things were going to turn out! Along the way, there are moments of genuine pathos that draw a tear from the eye; times of triumph that cause the heart to soar; instances of overwhelming tension that cause the adrenaline to surge; and images of spectacle that make the jaw drop. The pace is unflagging - once Jackson has us, he doesn't let go. When the movie was over, I couldn't believe that 3 1/4 hours had passed."", """", ""Although it's unfair to characterize the film as a collection of great moments - the character arcs and overall narrative are too strong for that - it is nevertheless impossible to deny the power of many individual scenes. One of Jackson's most notable contributions is that he directs the film with the intention that certain instances will raise nape hairs. It's the \""wow\"" factor, and it is frequently repeated. Gene Siskel once argued that a great film needs three memorable scenes to go along with no bad ones. The Return of the King exceeds that criteria by a considerable amount."", """", ""For those who despise truncated endings, Jackson has a treat in store. The Return of the King ends with a 20 minute epilogue that chronicles events after the War of the Ring, going as much as four years into the future and tying up nearly every possible loose end. The film concludes on exactly the same note as the book (in fact, with the same line), and, while the final chapter of the trilogy is as satisfying as it could possibly be, there's still a vague sense of melancholy when \""The End\"" appears on the screen, because it means that these adventures are over."", """", ""The acting shines through more in The Return of the King than in the other films. Elijah Wood is excellent as Frodo, a shell of the cheerful hobbit he once was. Sean Astin transforms Sam into a fierce knight protector, defending his master against the treacherous Gollum, the terrifying Shelob, and the forces of Mordor. Viggo Mortensen gives Aragorn his fullest opportunity to be seen as a three-dimensional hero. Newcomer John Noble, as Denethor, the Protector of Gondor, displays madness laced with cunning. Orlando Bloom and John Rhys-Davies have less to do, but provide us with a little comedic banter as well as some more serious moments. Miranda Otto's Eowen is as sharp and fierce as any man, and far better looking. Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan are given a chance to flesh out Pippin and Merry. Cate Blanchett, Liv Tyler, Hugo Weaving, and Ian Holm all make brief appearances."", """", ""Expectedly, the special effects set a new standard. The CGI participants of the major battles look more like real combatants than cartoonish computer creations. The locations, set design, and costumes are without flaw. By building many of the elaborate locales, Jackson achieves a sense of verisimilitude that he might not have attained by relying more heavily on computers. And composer Howard Shore's score is perfectly wed to the visuals, being alternately bombastic and delicate, as circumstances dictate."", """", ""The Lord of the Rings will go down in cinematic lore as a milestone."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

However, during more than four-dozen TV shows and movies, he has yet to challenge himself with the most difficult role for a well-liked actor - that of a bad-to-the-bone villain. He comes close in Road to Perdition, but doesn't quite reach that destination. For, although Michael Sullivan is a murderer for hire, he also has a conscience and a soul, loves his family, and kills not because he likes it but because it's his job. In short, Sullivan is portrayed sympathetically. The script's positive spin and Hanks' instant likeability ensure that Sullivan will be viewed not as a bad guy, but as a flawed man. There's some darkness there, to be sure, but not the pitch black of pure evil."", """", ""The film, director Sam Mendes' eagerly anticipated follow-up to American Beauty, is based on the \""graphic novel\"" (a term that is applied to a very long comic book printed on high-quality paper and sold in bookstores) by Max Allan Collins and Richard Piers Rayner. As with many adaptations from this medium, Road to Perdition stuns with its atmosphere and visuals, but arguably underachieves in some aspects of its characterization and plotting."", """", ""Road to Perdition allows you to feel, smell, and breathe the air of 1930s Chicago. To some extent, Conrad L. Hall is as big a star as any of the actors, since there are occasions when the setting overwhelms the characters. At its heart, Road to Perdition is a little drama about fathers, sons, and the covenants they make and break. Rooney betrays Sullivan to save Connor, even though, to the very end, he loves Sullivan best. Sullivan risks everything, including his life and reputation, to protect Michael. A telling conversation between Rooney and Sullivan italicizes this point. \""And there is only one guarantee--none of us will see Heaven,\"" says Rooney. \""Michael might,\"" replies Sullivan. Rooney then notes that it's Sullivan's primary duty to make sure that happens."", """", ""Road to Perdition romanticizes gangland Chicago, but no more so than other films set in the same period. And, like almost every movie about the mob, this one deals with themes of family, loyalty, and betrayal - albeit without the intensity of some of the great ones (The Godfather, Goodfellas).

The picture is a series of mini-climaxes, all building to the devastating, definitive conclusion."", """", ""Rarely does a film tell as many diverse-yet-interconnected stories. Strong performances, solid directing, and a tightly-plotted script all contribute to The Godfather's success. This motion picture was not slapped together to satiate the appetite of the masses; it was carefully and painstakingly crafted. Every major character - and more than a few minor ones - is molded into a distinct, complex individual.

In his own words, he is not a killer, and he never mixes business with personal matters. He puts family first (\""A man who doesn't spend time with his family can never be a real man\"") and despises displays of weakness. He understands the burden of power, and his wordless sympathy for Michael when he is forced to assume the \""throne\"", is one of The Godfather's most revealing moments (about both father and son)."", """", ""Family responsibility.

They are themes which have intrigued the greatest authors of every medium through the centuries."", """", ""Although the issues presented in The Godfather are universal in scope, the characters and setting are decidedly ethnic. Even to this day, there is an odd romanticism associated with New York's Italian crime families.

Francis Ford Coppola has tapped into this fascination and woven it as yet another element of the many that make his motion picture a compelling experience."", """", ""We come to The Godfather like Kay Adams - outsiders uncertain in our expectations - but it doesn't take long for us to be captivated by this intricate, violent world. The film can be viewed on many levels, with equal satisfaction awaiting those who just want a good story, and those who demand much more. The Godfather is long, yes - but it is one-hundred seventy minutes well-spent. When the closing credits roll, only a portion of the story has been told.

fight-club;10;MovieManiac83;/user/MovieManiac83;Apr 23, 2015;"[ ""With its kinetic style, visceral approach, compelling storyline, and powerful social message, Fight Club makes a commanding case to be considered the '90s version of A Clockwork Orange. In a time when so few motion pictures leave an impact, Fight Club refuses to be ignored or dismissed. The experience lingers, demanding to be pondered and considered, and, unlike 95% of modern-day thrillers, there is a great deal here to think about and argue over. Fight Club presents an overload of thought-provoking material that works on so many levels as to offer grist for the mills of thousands of reviews, feature articles, and post-screening conversations."", """", ""Pre-release interest in Fight Club was understandably high, primarily because of those involved with the project. Jim Uhls' script is based on an influential novel by Chuck Palahniuk (a book that, while not required material in schools, has consumed the free time of countless readers). The lead actor is the ever-popular Brad Pitt, who makes his strongest bid to date to shed his pretty boy image and don the mantle of a serious thespian. Those dubious about Pitt's ability to pull this off in the wake of his recent attempts in Seven Years in Tibet (which is briefly referenced as an in-joke during Fight Club) and Meet Joe Black will suffer a change of heart after seeing this film. Pitt's male co-star, Edward Norton, is widely recognized as one of the most intelligent and versatile performers of his generation. And Fight Club's director, David Fincher, has already made a huge artistic impression on movie-goers with only three features to his credit: Alien 3, Seven (starring Pitt), and The Game. Mix these elements together in Fox's publicity blender, and Fight Club will not carry the title of \""Best Movie of 1999 That No One Saw.\"""", """", ""Told in a conventional fashion, Fight Club would still have been engaging. However, Fincher's gritty, restless style turns it into a visual masterpiece. The overall experience is every bit as surreal as watching Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange. This is a tale that unfolds in an eerie alternate universe where the melodies of life have the same rhythm as in ours but are in a different key. Fincher also shows just enough restraint that his flourishes seem like important parts of the storytelling method instead of gimmicks. And there are a lot of them. In one scene, a character's apartment is laid out like a page in a furniture catalog, complete with text blurbs superimposed on the screen describing the various pieces. There are occasional single frame interruptions that flash by so quickly that they may pass unnoticed. The film opens with a truly inventive close-up - one that literally gets under the skin. Also in play: a non-linear chronology, a voiceover by a narrator who might not be entirely reliable, frequent breaking of the fourth wall, and an occasional freeze-frame. As was true of Fincher's other three films, Fight Club is dark and fast-paced. There's not a lot of time for introspection. One could call this MTV style, but, unlike many equally frantic movies, there's a reason for each quick cut beyond preventing viewers from becoming bored."", """", ""Perhaps the most discussed aspect of Fight Club will be its attitude towards and graphic depiction of violence. Even before the film's official premiere, voices have been raised claiming that the movie glorifies violence by portraying it as something positive. This was the complaint leveled against A Clockwork Orange, which, less than three decades after its controversial release, is universally regarded as a classic. There's no denying that Fight Club is a violent movie. Some sequences are so brutal that a portion of the viewing audience will turn away. (The scene that caused me to wince was when one character reached into his mouth and pulled out a loose tooth.) But the purpose of showing all this bloody pummeling is to make a telling point about the bestial nature of man and what can happen when the numbing effects of day-to-day drudgery cause people to go a little crazy. The men who become members of Fight Club are victims of the dehumanizing and desensitizing power of modern-day society. They have become cogs in a wheel. The only way they can regain a sense of individuality is by getting in touch with the primal, barbaric instincts of pain and violence."", """", ""It remains to be seen whether Fight Club will generate any Oscars. The strength of the writing, direction, and acting justifies a stream of nominations, but quality has never been the driving factor in who is recognized by the Academy. Regardless of how it is received in February, when the nominations are announced, Fight Club is a memorable and superior motion picture - a rare movie that does not abandon insight in its quest to jolt the viewer. This marriage of adrenaline and intelligence will make Fight Club a contender for many Best 10 lists at the end of 1999."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

As was true of director Steven Spielberg's other masterpiece, Schindler's List, the impact of this motion picture must be experienced; it cannot be adequately described. No film since last year's The Sweet Hereafter has left such a searing and indelible imprint on my mind and soul. This movie did not need to be released at the end of the year to be considered for a flood of Oscar nominations; it's so forceful that no one who sees it will be able to forget it -- not even Academy members with two-month memory spans."", """", ""Saving Private Ryan opens with a 30-minute cinematic tour de force that is without a doubt one of the finest half-hours ever committed to film. This sequence, a soldier's-eye view of the D-Day invasion of Normandy, is brilliant not only in terms of technique but in the depth of viewer reaction it generates. It is certainly the most violent, gory, visceral depiction of war that I have ever witnessed on screen. Spielberg spares the viewer nothing of the horrors of battle, using every tactic at his disposal to convey the chaos and senseless waste that lies at the core of any engagement. We are presented with unforgettable, bloody images of bodies being cut to pieces by bullets, limbs blown off, entrails spilling out, and a variety of other assorted examples of carnage. And, when the tide comes in with the waves breaking on the body-strewn beach, the water is crimson. Those who are at all squeamish will find the opening of Saving Private Ryan unbearable. This aspect of the film almost earned it an NC-17 rating; only the fact that Spielberg rigorously avoids even a hint of exploitation convinced the MPAA to award an R."", """", ""In addition to showing what happens when projectiles rip into the soft flesh of the human body, the director employs other methods to capture the essence of battle - hand-held cameras, a slight speeding up of the images, muted colors, and several different kinds of film stock. Put it all together, and it adds up to a dizzying, exhausting assault on the senses. As good as the rest of Saving Private Ryan is, and it's very good, the D-Day attack on Omaha Beach is the sequence that everyone will remember most clearly."", """", ""Most World War II movies fall into one of two categories: heroic tales of glory and valor or biopics (my all-time favorite film, Patton, falls in the latter camp). Saving Private Ryan is neither. Instead, it's a condemnation of war wrapped in a tale of human courage and sacrifice. In many ways, the picture painted by this movie is more grim than the one Oliver Stone presented in Platoon, which has often been cited as the most daring anti-war film to come out of Hollywood. Saving Private Ryan quickly and brutally dispels the notion that war is anything but vicious, demoralizing violence that makes a cruel joke out of the human body and spirit. Although the film is only loosely based on a true incident, it's hard not to accept these characters and events as real."", """", ""There's nothing especially complex about the structure of Saving Private Ryan. The film, which runs nearly three hours, is bookended by two major battle scenes. In between, smaller fights alternate with quiet, character-building moments that flesh out the soldiers, allowing them to escape the threat of stereotyping. Spielberg, along with writer Robert Rodat and the actors, ensures that everyone in the movie is developed into a multi-dimensional individual for whom we can grieve if and when they die. They are \""citizen soldiers\"" -- ordinary men caught in the teeth of extraordinary circumstances. With the exception of a little manipulation at the end (when tears are actually a welcome source of relief from the film's intensity), Saving Private Ryan rigorously avoids toying with our emotions."", """", ""With Saving Private Ryan set alongside Schindler's List, Steven Spielberg, once known as a purveyor of well-crafted-but-lightweight feel-good fare, has given us two of the decade's most gripping, disturbing, and powerful motion pictures. I consider Schindler's List to be one of the most amazing movies I have ever experienced, and, in many ways, Saving Private Ryan is its equal. Although both films take place during the same time period, they focus on different ideas. Schindler's List personifies good (Schindler) and evil (Amon Goeth), and plays out the struggle against a tragic backdrop. In Saving Private Ryan, there are no human villains, and the enemy isn't so much the Germans as it is the implacable, destructive specter of war. The film's central question (When is one life more important than another?) is never really answered. For those who are willing to brave the movie's shocking and unforgettable images, Saving Private Ryan offers a singular motion picture experience. I will be surprised if another film tops it for the best of 1998."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

interstellar;10;MovieManiac83;/user/MovieManiac83;Apr 23, 2015;"[ ""Christopher Nolan has never shied away from a challenge and the one he has taken on with Interstellar may be his most prodigious thus far - bigger than delivering an end-to-start chronology in Memento, more impressive than the mind-bending contortions of Inception, and more daunting than re-imagining Batman into the most unique superhero franchise of the 21st century. Interstellar is simultaneously a big-budget science fiction endeavor and a very simple tale of love and sacrifice. It is by turns edgy, breathtaking, hopeful, and heartbreaking. It's an amazing achievement that deserves to be seen on the biggest screen with the best sound system possible. Nolan has crafted Interstellar as a movie theater experience. Watching it at home, no matter how good the sound system is, won't match. This is one time when the IMAX surcharge is worth it."", """", ""Interstellar is science fiction. It's not space opera. It's not futuristic fantasy. It's what the term \""science fiction\"" was coined to represent. It presents a viable future in which space travel, while possible, is dangerous and uncertain. Starships aren't zipping from planet to planet. Space craft aren't firing lasers, phasers, or photon torpedoes. Travel across long distances uses the dangerous and unpredictable method of entering a wormhole, not engaging Warp One or making the jump to hyperspace. Time dilation comes into effect in the presence of a black hole and there's even a little bit about the relationship between quantum mechanics and relativity. This isn't Star Wars, Star Trek, or Guardians of the Galaxy, and anyone who approaches it with such expectations will be disappointed. It's more along the lines of recent movies like Contact (which also starred Matthew McConaughey) and Gravity in that it acknowledges science rather than ignoring the rules of reality as we understand them."", """", ""It will be difficult to find a review of Interstellar that doesn't reference 2001: A Space Odyssey and there's a valid reason for that. Nolan at times uses Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece as a template, especially during moments of grandeur. Hans Zimmer's score is no less crucial to Interstellar than \""Also Sprach Zarathustra\"" was to 2001. Yet, this is no mere copy of Kubrick's film; in fact, it goes far afield. There's heroism, a la The Right Stuff. It's also a warmer, more emotional experience - less stately and abstruse. In fact, found at the core of this big budget adventure is the most relatable thing imaginable: the feelings of love and trust that bind father and daughter. It's almost a fusion of Kubrick and Spielberg."", """", ""The film is nearly three hours but there's enough story here for something a lot longer. In condensing it, Nolan has made something 169 minutes in length that breezes by faster than many productions half its length. He accomplishes this by establishing a blistering pace during Interstellar's meatier sections, including expert cross-cutting between Earth and space during a powerful \""fire and ice\"" sequence."", """", ""Visually, Interstellar looks great. Nolan understands all the facets of special effects technology (except, perhaps, old age makeup) and uses them to their best. Hans Zimmer delivers an operatic score that, although occasionally drowning out dialogue (more a mixing issue than a scoring one), adds to the overall experience. Sound is important to Interstellar - when the rocket lifts off around the 45-minute mark, the bass shakes the entire theater."", """", ""It has been a tremendous year for McConaughey. From Dallas Buyers Club to True Detective to Interstellar, he has won a Golden Globe and an Oscar and been nominated for an Emmy. Interstellar will give him another opportunity for Academy recognition: he's the glue that holds everything together. He's the human factor in a vast universe. His love for his daughter and his pain when he acknowledges her despair invests this movie with a warmth and feeling that no previous Nolan movie can boast. The supporting cast, which includes Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, and Michael Caine, is strong, but McConaughey represents the heart and soul of Interstellar."", """", ""For anyone with a hunger for real science fiction rather than the crowd-pleasing, watered-down version Hollywood typically offers (and that I often enjoy immensely), Interstellar is a satisfying entrée. I'd rank this alongside Memento and The Dark Knight as the best Nolan has done, and it's an immediate contender for one of 2014's best.

In an infinite cosmos, everything falls within the realm of possibility, and that may be why science fiction is so enduring as an art form — it promises revelation. Science’s unfolding of the universe, freed from the morass of religious archetype, is the saga of modern spirituality that plays out in science fiction. Yet, there has always remained a quaint cautionary aspect to science fiction. Storytellers and audiences remain suckers for parable. As much as we crave escape into the unknown, we crave guidance from above, Christopher Nolan’s epic sci-fi film, “Interstellar,” explores the foibles of seeking either."", """", ""“Interstellar” is richly steeped in the classicism of science fiction, which is surprisingly hermetic as a genre. More often than not, science fiction stories are tales of apocalypse or transcendence, rocket-wreathed journeys of harrowing adventure. And like other sci-fi films before it, “Interstellar” walks familiar scorched earth. It is a cautionary tale, a vision of global apocalypse, in addition to being a Homeric journey of discovery. Yet “Interstellar” instantly defines itself as one of the landmarks of the genre. Transcendent and harrowing, it is probably the finest science fiction film produced in decades. What’s miraculous is how fresh Nolan makes his classically crafted sci-fiction film feel, shaping it with absolute modernity. “Interstellar” is Nolan’s best film to date and most certainly among the most beautiful science fiction films ever made."", """", ""The screenplay, written by Nolan and his brother, Johnathan, is unabashedly intelligent. Not since Paddy Chayefsky’s “Altered States” has such high-functioning dialogue been chewed onscreen by geeks. And while its constructed as neatly as a pyramid, the layers of the story might seem confusing to some unwilling to invest at least a little thought at the movies. But for those who venture into “Interstellar” for intelligent sci-fi, the threads of the tale weave themselves deliciously back together by its conclusion."", """", ""Even as it fulfills the sci-fi purist’s quest for substance,”Interstellar” is also a grandly orchestrated piece of popular entertainment, driven by family drama, suspense and moments of blazing action. It’s a complex film, ambitious in its artistry, yet a film that mainstream audiences won’t feel put off by. Clocking in at nearly three hours in length, “Interstellar” is also a marathon of a movie. It’s a movie for the bingeing generation. Yet its length is befitting the ambitions of its story and the stately verisimilitude of Nolan’s mise-en-scène."", """", ""“Interstellar” is set in the not-so-far away future when a dust storm-whipped Earth teeters on extinction. It’s not greenhouse gases or oil reserves that have done in mankind, but a vegetative blight starving out nations and throwing the planet’s O2 levels into chaos. Nolan wisely does little finger-pointing (Monsanto, anyone?) or proselytizing in his story. It suffices to say that the world is quickly going out with a whimper, not a bang."", """", ""The big moments of planetary splendor even outshine the seminal work Kubrick did in “2001: A Space Odyssey.” Jaw dropping images of tumbling spacecraft spinning through the rings of Saturn, helpless and dwarfed by the giant denizens of our solar system, are breathtaking. Those seeking a visual trip to space won’t be disappointed: planetary splendor is on plentiful display. And the special effects depicting where no man has gone before — through the mystery of worm holes and black holes — coupled with Han Zimmer’s blistering score that nearly renders you unconscious at times, are cosmic thrill rides that you won’t soon forget."", """", ""Nolan lays down his particle physics and turns to his metaphysics in a storyline that suggests the greatest self-perpetuating force in the universe is our spiritual bond to each other. Unlike Kubrick’s orgasmic Nietzschean rendezvous at the finale of “2001” with the supreme being, Nolan turns to Jung’s animus and anima, the masculine and feminine archetypes of the subconscious mind, for his own unifying theory.  Kubrick has always been accused of being an icy thinker, but it’s here that Nolan proves himself to be the man of science, at least psychology. And Cooper’s voyage to the edge of a black hole, where time bends like a willow front, is cleverly played out in context of the chasm of separation between father and daughter. Their love and loss transmitted over the years in melancholy, one-sided electronic messages, is perhaps another parable for our times."", """", ""Nolan has always loved playing with the structure of his films, framing them like Chinese puzzles and “Interstellar” is no different. But he does it here with such subtlety and well-defined logic that there’s no overly clever feel to his devicing in “Interstellar” — the story feels natural and inevitable and works perfectly within the genre of science fiction."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

Throughout the toys' journey, they end up at Sunnyside daycare. It seems a friendly and inviting place at first, but inside it's like a dystopia. I can't help but think this is modeled off of some human society, but portrayed with a social hierarchy in toys instead. This movie doesn't lack on the comedy either. Ken and Barbie feel like they were \""made for each other.\"" Guess they never would have guessed that they actually were."", """", ""One of the most significant parts of the movie to me was the soundtrack.

We learn that she's more responsible than her own mother and has to provide for the entire family. The most striking to me in this movie were the intensely vivid and realistic scenes.

With only 6 more days of school until graduation I totally relate to the whole moving away aspect. The whole tone of the movie was set in the opening scenes, with Laser asking Joni to call their sperm donor.

I could completely feel what Joni was feeling as she ran out to make sure her family didn't leave her without saying goodbye. I think one of the most intriguing aspects of this movie is the fact that there are so many roles for people to relate to depending on who they are. There are the moms–and so many aspects to them.

Such characters were subject to magical settings and themes and more fantastical elements displayed than ever before, and it was brilliant. Whilst no film is perfect, demonstrated as a few characters were underdeveloped and will hopefully play a bigger role in future acts, no character is expendable however and whether they are on screen for thirty seconds or an hour, each has a part to play in the progression of the story. The magic of the force, the magic of the lightsaber, the magic of aliens and starships, the magic of the Star Wars blockbuster, the magic has all returned and promises to thrive for years to come. The Force Awakens exceeds all expectations, and with perhaps one of the most emotional and spectacular final shot’s in any film to date, the audience is left both wanting to immediately watch the movie again and wanting to watch Episode 8. After years of anxious waiting, and years of positive signs we can finally confirm, JJ Abrams has done it. Star Wars is back."" ]";224;287;224;63;0;0

Spectacularly gripping from start to finish, the film showers its viewers with moments of awe and insanity, with the ability to bring them back down to earth with emotional and harshly realistic aspects. Whilst Tom Hardy is faultless in his Bane-like performance, Charlize Theron and her band of freedom fighters steal the show. George Miller thoroughly demonstrates his skill as a director, providing a magical yet scarily realistic portrayal of his imagined dystopian future.

It is like going on a weekend retreat where you had deep conversations with someone you never would meet otherwise. I did not read even the movie description before seeing it but knew Bill Murry and Scarlett Johansson somehow are strangers that become friends or something, so I had no clue what it was about. I thought Scarlett may even be a kid in it, but she is a young woman in the movie.  I could not get enough of the quirkiness of the characters, their conversations, and the situations they find in a new foreign place, Kyoto Japan. The movie is sometimes funny, yet also sometimes turns to serious yearning, and the combination is believable.  If you want a normal romantic comedy then you may not want this, as it is more off beat and harder to label. The main actors and background characters do such a great job of giving the movie a feeling of not acting, more like they are just living a documentary.  The side characters did great to make it feel real. I do wonder if anyone has an issue with the cultural portrayal of Japanese because they focus more on unusual characters but it is probably like viewing Las Vegas as a portrayal of American culture.

When I watched The LEGO Movie, in February 2014, my expectations were actually exceeded. The film is a success for many different reasons, thanks to its many layers of meaning; it gives the audience not only what they want, but also what they don’t know they want just yet. The story, focused on different aspects of the LEGO experience, combines impeccable CGI action, surprisingly sharp social critique, and a heartwarming message. As if this wasn’t enough, it’s directed by 21 Jump Street’s hot duo Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, and its voice cast includes Chris Pratt (you’ll see him in Guardians of the Galaxy soon), Will Ferrell, Elizabeth Banks and Will Arnett. Plus Morgan Freeman voicing Vitruvius, the half-looney half-prophet wizard. And did I mention Liam Neeson, playing Bad Cop (or Good Cop, depending on what turn his interrogation takes)? Considering the past results in developing a cinematic product based on well-established brands (mostly hit and miss, to use an understatement), the outcome is astonishingly positive. The LEGO Movie has become Warner Bros. Pictures’ most commercially successful animated film, grossing almost $500 million worldwide, and soon due for release in DVD and Blu-ray. Whereas extra content is meagre (limited to three amateur shorts and the film’s main song singalong video), it’s well worth saving The LEGO Movie a spot on your shelf."", """", ""The LEGO Movie’s story develops the proverbial “Everyman turns into hero” arch in three acts: the film opens presenting Emmet, an ordinary construction worker who lives following instructions. President Business tells him (and all citizens) what to do and decides what should make him happy, and Emmet is ecstatic to comply: he buys overpriced coffee, endlessly quotes awful sitcom catchphrases, sings to the most annoying (and most memorable) tune in the history of made-to-be-abhorred songs, happily follows every precept of his society in order to fit in. Sounds like the world surrounding you, doesn’t it? Well, Emmet also happens to be the “Chosen One”, he who is revealed will save the LEGO universe from the threat of Business’s secret weapon: superglue. Along with a team of whacky rebels, Emmet will travel across lands in a journey of self-discovery, personal growth and meta-reflections on the spirit of LEGO as a product. With a closing moral that poignantly celebrates art for art’s sake."", """", ""Who initially thought that all this is just product placement, may want to take a closer look: The LEGO Movie doesn’t make you want to buy and play LEGO, it just makes you want to watch the film again and again. You can’t get enough of its hilarious and nipping approach, elevating even the most mundane stuff into joie de vivre: from special effects entirely made of LEGO (explosions, smoke, fire, and even the shower’s water) and over-the-top action sequences, to countless cool references to pop culture and the history of LEGO (Benny, the \""1980-something space guy\"" with an obsession for building spaceships, wears an helmet cracked in the exact spot where real-life LEGO pieces would usually break). I could go on forever. The LEGO Movie is the kind of film that you find yourself quoting as soon as you leave the cinema: “And when this happens… and when Vitruvius says… and when Batman does this and that…”. Oh boy, I feel like I’m 10 again. At that age I had a few cherished VHS of animated classics that I never grew tired of watching: The Sword in the Stone, 101 Dalmatians, Robin Hood, Toy Story. If I were that boy now, The LEGO Movie would surely earn a place among them."" ]";1;3;1;2;0;0
django-unchained;9;aadityamudhar;/user/aadityamudhar;Apr 17, 2016;"[ ""Another classic from the legend that is Quentin Tarantino. He simply doesn't deliver average films and 'Django Unchained' continues his wonderful work. Set in the Deep South and Old West, a freed slave (Jamie Foxx) embarks on a trail across America with a German bounty hunter (Christoph Waltz) to rescue his wife from a charismatic and cruel plantation owner (Leo DiCaprio.) The sequences are sensational from the very beginning but the key component in making this film so great is the two intriguing characters at the heart of it, Foxx and Waltz. Inglourious Basterds was a marvellous movie and I thought that Waltz was the shining light and once again he steals the show. He really is an actor on top of his game under the stewardship of Tarantino and he excels. Compared to other Tarantino outings the film is much more linear excluding less flashbacks. Some will complain about the elements of racism but it's part of what Tarantino is tackling with Django. Foxx proves to be a hit in the lead role and delivers a solid performance. It was a genius piece of casting having Leo DiCaprio as the villain. He is a supreme talent and possibly the finest actor of this generation and once more he is in flawless form as the villain of the movie. As usual Samuel L. Jackson makes an appearance and he, as always, is ever dependable. There's also cameo's from the Director himself, Tarantino and Jonah Hill. Django Unchained is without a doubt one of the best films you'll likely see all year round. It's a must see film and another masterstroke from Quentin Tarantino! It has everything you'd expect from one of his films. The laughs are their in abundance, the actions sequences are superb but there's also the serious issues of racism and slavery at the heart of the tale. And to top it off, there's a stellar cast as always delivering outstanding performances. It is a bit on the long side coming in at just under 3 hours but it's a journey you just have to take all the way through to it's grand stand finish! Make no mistake Django is another work of magic from the maestro that is Quentin Tarantino."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

Perhaps a little, it certainly stands on its own two feet, but the fact remains that we are introduced to these various characters but only get a handful of them.

When the boat transporting the kidnapped south moves, you see the paddlewheels. On the plantations, you see the three or four acres where the slaves live.

Let's go straight to the movie. Captain America: Civil War is that one movie I was dying to see and finally got the wish to do so. Unlike Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, Captain America: Civil War has violence, joy, and power. When the Avengers became two different sides due to extreme disagreement, that's where we're beginning to get real violence like in the comics. Choose your side. I choose Captain America not just because it's his movie, it's that he is doing it for justice and that's what I love about Captain America. I mean I don't want to flame if you join Iron Man, but that's with me. If I had to versus this to Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, Captain America: Civil War will win 100%. No one was expecting this at all (especially Spider-Man being a show stealer) and that's how Captain America: Civil War becomes another recipe for the Marvel Cinematic Universe and a fresh start to the third phrase. It also introduces Black Panther to the Marvel Cinematic Universe as well. In any way, this felt more like an \""Avengers 2.5\"" movie than a normal Captain America movie, but I still love it regardless of the entire situation.

The soundtrack is just breathtaking. There are amazing scenes, like the cornfield chase scene and the water planet disaster. I do agree that this movie has flaws. Some characters are underdeveloped. Why is Cooper's son in the movie? He's just kinda.. there. The only use he has is to add conflict near the end. It's also odd how Murph holds a grudge on Cooper for so many years. Nobody would be that stubborn. Some of Cooper's crew is just kinda there, like his son. They are never developed. The guy with the beard dies when they reach the water planet and the black guy dies on the ice planet. They are never developed. The movie is more focused on story rather than characters. Even the story is flawed sometimes. For example, we hear about Cooper's wife once and how she died, yet she is never mentioned again. Don't you think she should be a bigger part of Cooper's life? At this point, I'm just nitpicking small things. The movie overall is amazing. Movies are about experiencing awe and wonder, and Interstellar does that well.

Really, it's a wonder it doesn't collapse under it's own weight. But but thanks to a mix of smart writing and exciting action it really, really doesn't; Whedon recognises the equal importance of some great scenes without all that fighting to ground the team dynamic and character relationships.

And wow does he succeed; achieving this by grounding the character's and their stories, creating a deeper and more philosophical undertone, whilst still building an even bigger, explosive action spectacle. This combination of beautifully grounded character detail, philosophies and crazy action makes it a hell of a roller coaster. But does it just collapse under it's own weight? Some think so, but I disagree. Whilst it does jump around, you get enough time at each point to get really involved, and the story's writing even lends itself to the jumpy nature, each scene beautifully setting up the next. It flows. And that's largely down to Whedon."", ""So whilst it is certainly an ambitious roller coaster ride of pop-corn entertainment with great, explosive action, special effects and setup, Whedon manages to pull all that enjoyable stuff together in a way that the movie still feels personal; a roller coaster in terms of the way it makes you feel.

This movie is a sheer delight and it's no wonder why it won best picture at the academy awards. The voice actor who voices dug is a pure delight and the rest of the cast is too.

More of the fantastic humor and sometimes it's even better humor than the first and new comer hank azaria brings a charming yet deliciously fun evil role to the pharaoh. Some new comers who also shine are Amy Adams as amilia earheart.

Anyway the whole cast is fantastic and my favorite part is the confrontation. The sword play and intense singing are just the perfect match. The one problem I had with this is that there are a couple points in the plot that don't exactly weave together well.

The one thing i do agree is that it could have had better character development. also In the movies second act the action was powerful and the final fight was well done but I though there could have cut at least one action scene of took a break for just a little.

I have read parts of the book and I don't get why people are making such a big fuss about the book to movie adaptation. Some of the lines and scenes are taking straight from the book. Martin freeman is brilliant playing bilbo baggins and just like the LOTR there are some very good flash back sequences. The dwarfs were a good combination of funny and brutish. Bilobos game of riddles with gullom was one of the best parts of the movie and Ian mckellan does very good as gandalf. Now the pacing could have been better and the first 45 minutes with the dwarfs were entertaining but could have been cut down. Plus The scene with the stone giants was cool but I felt it had no part in the movie and peter jack son just added it in for the spectacle. Also The scenes with radagast did not feel like they belonged in the movie and sorta slowed the movie down.

I mean whats up with Hollywood and generic villains. I felt that zachary quinto didn't brought a little more humor to his character than i would have liked he was still good as always though, Also The twist near the end where the villains revels his motivations are about as bland as they come.

Now that I know the history of N.W.A, it really makes rap music for me more interesting than it did before. The movie is well directed and it has humor and drama at the appropriate times. And the ending was really a surprise to me, because I really didn't have a clue about these rappers' histories, I just knew them by their name. There are some fantastic scenes in this movie that are so unforgettable. However, I have heard that some of these characters are sometimes inaccurately represented in this movie and the movie left out some events, but still I really liked this movie a lot.

Mystery, hardship, death, and the terrifying void of space are present throughout the entire film, which kept me hooked. Any fan of science fiction films or even films set in space needs to experience Sunshine, in all it's radiant glory."" ]";0;0;0;0;0;0

They really have a father/daughter relationship, and throughout the film we get to see how much they care for each other.

Baby is a really likeable and interesting character, supported by the rest of the cast. The story is riveting, especially as the movie ramps up towards the final climax. The film primarily relies on practical effects and stunts making the car chases and gun fights more believable and satisfying to watch. The music, cinematography, and fast paced editing give the film a really unique style you cannot help but get into. The story also does a terrific job of balancing light and dark themes. Certain points in the movie have a lot of heart whereas others are not afraid to get violent. You get to see the contrast between different characters; some believe in making moral decisions whereas others only look out for themselves. This adds a really interesting dynamic between the main characters. Overall I loved Baby Driver, it was everything I was hoping it to be. Even if you do not feel as strongly about the movie as I do, it is still hard to be disappointed by this film."" ]";1;7;1;6;0;0

Its a fantastic film period. I've never really been into the X-Men universe but Logan caught my eye as it focuses more on emotion, character development, and relationships rather than on CGI action and over the top spectacle. The film tells a brutally realistic story about an old beaten Wolverine who wants to move on in life but gets pulled back into a problem. But this problem is very personal to Logan, making for the characters to really shine and resonate with you long after seeing the movie. I loved all the performances; from of course Logan, to Professor X, to the little girl, to the villain, etc. The direction and writing were excellent, the cinematography was fantastic, and the gore and practical filming locations really added to the realism and tone of the story.

The casting is on point, Emma and Ryan give amazing performances and have really good chemistry together. The writing is thoughtful and clever as well, providing a great message and sastisfying twists along the way. And because it is a musical, I of course have to mention the dance pieces. They are wonderful. I love the song choices and the choreography of the dances. I also really appreciated the cinematography, as they chose to use a lot of long takes with smooth zooms and pans to follow the action rather than cutting all the time. And coming from seeing Whiplash I really enjoyed all the little references to that film, I feel as though La La Land is an unofficial sequel to it. Overall, it is a beautifully crafted film with a lot of heart and wonder. If you are a fan of musicals or just great movies in general you need to see this one."" ]";3;4;3;1;0;0

It maybe has too many 'Hollywood' (pun intended) actors for my taste, since the film is set during WW2. But they all deliver really great performances, especially Andrew Garfield as Desmond Doss. He did such an amazing job that you really care about what he believes in. The writing and depiction of the war were also great. Gibson doesn't shy away from showing you the realities of war and the effects (both physical and psychological) it has on people. Doss' backstory was done very cleverly and makes you truly understand why he won't kill. The music and cinematography (especially during battle scenes) are beautiful. I'm so glad I got to see this movie right before Remembrance Day. It truly is a spectacular film based on a spectacular true story. When it comes to the ending, all I can say is wow.

The story continues to get more and more interesting as the characters unravel new information. Because of this the writing and direction were really great, especially how everything comes together in the ending. Casting Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner as the leads were solid choices, they both bring really great performances to their roles.

I can rest peacefully at night knowing Star Wars is in good hands. Now I just have to wait until Episode 8, it can't come soon enough."" ]";4;9;4;5;0;0

The cinematography is very well done especially the opening where the camera goes through the Edinburgh streets. This suggests the city is all the same rather than what it is going to be when we follow on with the trio. The music is superb, the Simon Boswell piano theme is well suited and also suits for the horror genre, I don't really find this as a standard black comedy thriller, it is something like it is ripped off from Coen Brother's Blood Simple, with more of less funny dialogue but I find this a perfect thriller and quite known for its time and still is today because of Channel 4 which is now a popular channel with many sub-channels.
